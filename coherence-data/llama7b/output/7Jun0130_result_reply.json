In a move likely to infuriate Senate Republicans, President Barack Obama's national security adviser Tom Donilon is resigning to be replaced by U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, marking a significant shakeup to the White House foreign policy team. A White House official confirmed the personnel changes Wednesday morning ahead of a planned announcement by the president later at 2.30 p.m. in the Rose Garden.

Rice is to become President Barack Obama's national security adviser, it was reported today . Rice, a close Obama confidante, came under withering criticism from Republicans as part of the investigations into the deadly terror attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Christopher Stevens. The . emails revealed the drafting and radical re-drafting of the . administrations storyline in anticipation of Rice's appearances on . television. The CIA, led at the time by David Petraeus wanted to include references to militant threats from Islamic extremists - but ultimately these were removed after objections from various White House figures. While it is not clear what level of involvement Rice had in the evolution of the 'talking points', officials speaking in her defense said that she was only reiterating the information she was handed.

    "article": "By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A young cancer victim took the brave but life-saving decision to amputate her leg below the knee after doctors warned the disease could spread. Sophie Walton, from Upminster in Havering, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs. Specialists told the now 21-year-old, her only chance of survival was to remove her right leg below the knee. Without hesitation Miss Walton  agreed, putting her faith in her medical team, and has since been told she is free of the disease. Scroll down for video . Sophie Walton, 21, from Upminster, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs . Specialists told Miss Walton her only chance of survival was to amputate her right leg below the knee . She said: 'I underwent a high dose of chemo but after seven rounds I was told it wasn't effective. 'My surgeon called me in and said, \"how would you feel if I said you need your leg amputated?\" 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. 'I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice. 'My first concern was, 'how am I going to wear a bikini or dresses on holiday?' 'I was devastated but I tried not to think about it.' Miss Walton first spotted a lump on her right foot after a night out with friends. Doctors thought she had broken her foot - something an X-ray later confirmed, but when the bone failed to heal properly, she was given an MRI scan which highlighted an abnormal growth. By the time her bone cancer was diagnosed it had already spread to her lungs . Just one week after her surgeon delivered the shocking news that she may need her leg amputation, the operation went ahead. She said: 'I was pain free when I woke up but I didn't feel relieved. 'I remember looking down and being able to see and feel one leg but not the other. 'It was hard at first but as soon as I got home we moved my room downstairs and I used a wheelchair to get around. 'It took a few weeks for my stump to heal properly and for my prosthesis to be fitted.' Before having her amputation the 21-year-old had gruelling rounds of chemotherapy to try and shrink the cancer in her lungs. She said: 'It was really scary when we were told it had spread to my lungs as I knew that would be hard to treat.' She said: 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice' Miss Walton made the brave decision to trial a new drug - a stronger form of chemotherapy, that could save her life but would leave her infertile. 'I had to give myself the best chance of survival,' she said. 'I had plenty of time in the future to think about how I would have children. 'I'd already lost my thick, long blonde hair with the first lot of chemotherapy.' After finishing her trial drug treatment Miss Walton's health took another turn for the worst. She had a low liver function and her gull bladder had become inflamed. Doctors diagnosed her with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) - a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed and is a known complication of high-dose chemotherapy. She said: 'It's a rare complication but it turned my eyes yellow and I was in hospital for around six weeks before being released.' But after a year of operations and treatment, in January 2013, Miss Walton was given the amazing news that the trial chemotherapy drug had worked, 90 per cent of the cancer in her lungs had disappeared. In February, she underwent an operation to remove the remaining cancer nobles from her lungs. Two weeks later she was given the all clear. 'I had check-ups every two months to begin with but now it's every three,' she said. 'I also see a reproductive doctor as the chemo has left me completely infertile. 'The year I had cancer was definitely easier than the past year. I was left with no leg, no hair and I had to drop out of university. 'I felt as though I was starting everything from scratch.' But with the support of her mother, Debra, 53, father, Steve, 59, step-dad, Richard, 52, and her two sisters, Rhyanna, 26 and Lara, 28, Miss Walton is now looking forward to the future. She said: 'I've enrolled to do veterinary care at college this month which I can't wait to start. 'I have been on holiday a few times since losing my leg too. I know I'll be back wearing shorter dresses in no time.' Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive officer said: 'Sophie's fight back to fitness after her bone cancer diagnosis and amputation is a real triumph and inspiration, not only for her friend Mark, who will run in her honour, but also for others facing bone cancer. 'All funds raised by Team Bones participants in the Great North Run on Sunday, will help us ensure this charity drives forward even more research that will make this rare and devastating cancer a curable disease. 'Primary bone cancer is a cruel and degrading disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year. Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars.

The capture of the Quneitra crossing by Syrian rebels, including members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. The border crossing made headlines earlier this week, when American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was handed over on the Syrian side of the checkpoint by the al-Nusra Front to U.N. peacekeepers. During the fighting on Wednesday between Syrian forces and rebels, three errant mortar rounds and some small-arms fire crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. An Israeli military officer was moderately injured, the IDF said on Twitter, and Israeli forces responded by striking two Syrian military positions. The Israeli military has closed the area around the border crossing. An activist in the Golan Heights, Shamil al-Jolani, said the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya and other rebel groups, not all of them Islamist, also were involved in the fighting. Video from the scene showed heavy smoke rising from the Syrian side of the crossing. A journalist working with CNN said that heavy shelling and gunfire erupted earlier from the Syrian side but that the situation had since calmed. Jolani said some fighters were able to reach the crossing despite bombardment by Syrian warplanes. Because of agreements with Israel, Syrian forces could not bomb the forces at the crossing, he said. Wednesday's fighting marks at least the second time rebels have attacked the crossing. In June 2013, rebels and Syrian forces battled for control of Quneitra. The violence prompted Austrian troops to pull out of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights. Israel sent tanks and troops to the border for a time, as well. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War, and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights.

    "article": "(CNN) -- Two rights groups launched a stinging critique Wednesday on Russia's freedom of expression record, citing a heavy clampdown on critics and activists since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. The reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch highlight changes to the law that they say have helped authorities stifle dissent. Opinion: Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' \"In the year since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in May 2012, the Russian government has unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history,\" Human Rights Watch said in its report. \"The authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws, harassed, intimidated, and in several cases imprisoned political activists, interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies, thereby threatening the viability of Russia's civil society.\" Opinion: Why Pussy Riot matters . At least two new laws have been introduced and 11 amended in the past year, according to Amnesty International, including broad provisions that allow for \"arbitrary interference\" with the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. As a result, the space for political opposition and other forms of dissent is \"rapidly shrinking,\" it said. \"These recent legal initiatives have the declared aim of ensuring public order and the protection of the rights of citizens,\" it said. \"Their effect has been the opposite: prominent government critics, opposition voices, watchdogs and ordinary individual protesters (on a wide range of issues) have all seen their rights restricted over the course of the last year.\" This is happening even though these rights are explicitly guaranteed by the nation's constitution and international human rights treaties to which Russia is party, Amnesty points out. Opinion: Russia's civil society crackdown continues . Two of the new laws \"clearly seek to limit, or even end, independent advocacy and other NGO work,\" Human Rights Watch said. One, the \"foreign agents\" law, requires any group receiving foreign funding and engaging in \"political activities\" to register as a \"foreign agent,\" the report said. Inspections conducted by authorities to enforce this law \"appeared aimed, at minimum, to intimidate civil society activists\" and could potentially be used to force some groups to either end certain types of work or close altogether, it said. Internet content has also been subjected to new legal restrictions, and another law on freedom of assembly imposes limits on public demonstrations and drastic fines on those who violate it, it added. Russia's government has not yet responded to the reports. Kremlin critic in court . Meanwhile, the trial of prominent Kremlin critic and opposition leader Aleksei Navalny resumed in a court in Kirov, a city about 500 miles northeast of Moscow. Navalny, a popular anti-corruption blogger, is accused of embezzling $510,000 worth of timber when he worked for the governor of the Kirov area. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million rubles ($32,000) if convicted. Navalny says the charges are revenge for his criticism of senior Russian officials and allegations of corruption by managers of state-run firms, the official RIA Novosti news agency reported. The case was previously closed by prosecutors in spring 2012 for lack of evidence, the Human Rights Watch report said. Navalny has been detained several times by Russian authorities over his political protest activities. In one example, in October of last year he was detained and charged after staging a one-man protest over police torture in front of the headquarters of the Federal Security Service in Moscow, Human Rights Watch said. Permission is not needed to stage a one-man protest. Navalny told a court that after he finished his protest, a group of journalists followed him to ask questions, \"at which point he was detained and charged with organizing an unauthorized rally,\" the report said. Amnesty International's report also raises concerns about past court cases brought against Navalny. Putin's election to a third term as president in May 2012 came less than six months after parliamentary elections sparked the largest protests seen in decades in Russia. The issue of free speech in Russia was thrust into the international spotlight last year with the trial of three members of the punk band Pussy Riot, a legal action widely condemned by rights groups. All three women were convicted of hooliganism for performing a song critical of Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral, in a brief but provocative protest action. Two are still in prison.",

    "article": "(CNN) -- Puffing on electronic cigarettes is already a no-no on flights, but the government wants there to be no doubt. The Department of Transportation is proposing to explicitly ban the use of the devices on planes. \"Airline passengers have rights, and this new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion surrounding the use of electronic cigarettes in flight,\" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Electronic cigarettes look like the real thing, but they're actually battery-operated devices that turn nicotine into a vapor that is inhaled by the user, according to the FDA. They're a potential cause for concern because \"there is a lack of scientific data and knowledge of the ingredients in electronic cigarettes,\" the DOT said. But the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association criticized the move, insisting that the devices only emit water vapor. \"It makes absolutely zero sense,\" said Ray Story, the group's CEO. \"It only gives the smoker a dosage of nicotine, but it doesn't do anything else to the innocent bystander. ... I have sat next to people who wore a particular type of cologne that was far more intrusive than what this particular product is.\" The DOT believes its current ban on smoking of tobacco products is broad enough to include electronic cigarettes, but wants to eliminate any confusion. Some airline passengers have been \"vaping\" on planes, convinced that the devices are exempt from the ban. In July, a Sandy, Utah, man was arrested after an altercation that began when he started using an electronic cigarette on board a Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. The story prompted hundreds of comments from CNN.com readers, many defending electronic cigarettes and arguing they're a smoke-free way to provide relief for passengers suffering from nicotine withdrawals during a flight. \"The problem is not with the people using this device, but with the people around them who are psychologically affected by the fact that it LOOKS like a cigarette and someone is sucking on it,\" one commenter wrote. But others worried about the safety of using the devices at 35,000 feet, as well as their health effects on others. \"I sat next to someone who was e-smoking and it's impossible to contain all of the nicotine mist. I don't want to breathe that stuff and shouldn't have to sit next to someone on a plane who is spewing chemically loaded mist. Get a patch or nicotine gum if your addiction is that bad,\" a commenter wrote. The DOT's proposed rule would apply to all U.S. and foreign airlines on scheduled flights to and from the United States. Officials are also considering whether to extend the ban on smoking to charter flights. Amtrak has already banned the use of e-cigarettes on trains and in any area where smoking is prohibited, the DOT said, and the U.S. Navy doesn't allow them below decks in submarines. The government will accept public comments on the proposal until November 14.",

ALS ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE: . Everyone from David Beckham to Anna Wintour has now completed the Ice Bucket Challenge for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also referred to as motor neurone disease. It started in August as a fun way to raise awareness and funds for charities like the ALS Association and MND Association and involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads before nominating other people to get involved. The trend began in America and took off when Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part. Pete Frates, a former standout baseball player at Boston College, had a very happy 30th birthday this month, pictured with his wife Julie .

His mother Jane told of her heartbreak at the death of the 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' teen who in the end raised more than £3million for charity. NEK NOMINATE: . NekNominate was an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game after he uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same. He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game .

The video posted on the internet sees her walking into the supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat and walking around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle. Rebbeca Dagley, 19, stripped down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders and downed a can of beer in front of shocked shoppers in Asda . She then takes a can of Stella Artois from her pocket, removes her coat, stripping down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders and downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers. The act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part. Meanwhile Steph-Lou Jones chose a Baywatch swimming costume, McDonald's and a pint of beer for her challenge. But Throfinn Stout, who downed a pint while flying a small aircraft, and Squaddie James Steel, who drank a goldfish, attracted criticism for their attempts at the controversial drinking challenge.

Kanye West's ex-lover Amber Rose showed just how much she has in common with his new wife as she posted her version of Kim's famous shot in October. The 30-year-old showed off her incredible derriere in a tiny dollar bill-themed bathing suit, and the picture has since been liked more than 147,000 times. While 2014 was also the year TOWIE star Lauren Goodger was threatened with a lawsuit by Carmen Ortega, who claims her belfie was ripped off. Goodger, 28, reportedly stole the saucy snap from the Instagram of 27-year-old US model and posted it on her own page with the caption: 'Nightmare wife.' Within a few hours of posting it, some followers pointed out that the picture had been taken from Carmen's profile, lightened and had the waist widened. Lauren then deleted the picture. A few days later Carmen tweeted with two forbidding hashtags - '#lawsuit' and '#TheEnd' - while Lauren wrote that she never made out the picture was of her.

ALS ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE: . Everyone from David Beckham to Anna Wintour has now completed the Ice Bucket Challenge for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also referred to as motor neurone disease. It started in August as a fun way to raise awareness and funds for charities like the ALS Association and MND Association and involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads before nominating other people to get involved. The trend began in America and took off when Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part. Pete Frates, a former standout baseball player at Boston College, had a very happy 30th birthday this month, pictured with his wife Julie .

STEPHEN SUTTON . Cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton, who tweeted at @_stephensstory, raised £3million for charity in his final months battling the disease. The 19-year-old, who had been diagnosed with bowel cancer, drew up a bucket list of things he wanted to achieve before he died. At the head of his 46 goals was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Knowing he did not have long left, he dropped out of school to concentrate on fundraising, and his efforts were so successful that he soon increased his target to £1million.

Benedict Cumberbatch supported Stephen's campaign, as did Jimmy Carr, pictured here in an image from the Stephen's Story Facebook page . When in April he was rushed to hospital with breathing problems after one of his lungs collapsed, he believed he had just days to live and urged people to help him reach his target. After the teenager posted a message online donations started to flood in and he had soon passed £1million. He was also sent messages of support by celebrities from Piers Morgan to Sir Chris Hoy and Russell Brand. Celebrities, politicians and classmates joined his family in an outpouring of grief after the youngster lost his fight for life. Thousands flocked to donate in his memory as news of his loss spread via social media, causing the page to temporarily crash. His mother Jane told of her heartbreak at the death of the 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' teen who in the end raised more than £3million for charity. NEK NOMINATE: . NekNominate was an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game after he uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same. He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game . In some instances, teens are seen downing 'dirty pints' - or concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong spirits as part of the dare. Rebbeca Dagley, 19, infamously stripped in Asda before downing a can of lager in February. The video posted on the internet sees her walking into the supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat and walking around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle. Rebbeca Dagley, 19, stripped down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders and downed a can of beer in front of shocked shoppers in Asda . She then takes a can of Stella Artois from her pocket, removes her coat, stripping down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders and downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers. The act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part. Meanwhile Steph-Lou Jones chose a Baywatch swimming costume, McDonald's and a pint of beer for her challenge. But Throfinn Stout, who downed a pint while flying a small aircraft, and Squaddie James Steel, who drank a goldfish, attracted criticism for their attempts at the controversial drinking challenge.

    "article": "Jailed: Grandmother-of-two Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax . A grandmother-of-two who was jailed over unpaid council tax was freed just in time to spend Christmas at home with her family after an online appeal raised enough money to pay off her debts. Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax. But, just 48 hours before Christmas, the 52-year-old was released from HMP Bronzefield near Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill. A viral online campaign was launched to free the grandmother, on the grounds that she was on a low income and devoted her time to caring for others in her community. Mrs Buckle, of Newbury, Berkshire, was said to be a carer on a zero-hours contract, earning just £7 an hour for around 25 hours a week. It was claimed that this left her without the means to pay the bill from West Berkshire Council. The man who led the campaign to free the grandmother said she had been 'overwhelmed' with the support she had received. He said: 'She was over the moon, absolutely overwhelmed with all the support and the work that has been going on behind the scenes to get her released. She was quite unaware of it. 'She's back home now. She's having a lovely Christmas with her family.' When she was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court on November 18, it was only the second time the district council had been granted a custodial sentence for the non-payment of council tax. Mrs Buckle owed £3,500 in council tax at the time, which was reduced by £60 for each day she was in prison. Speaking at the time of the conviction, the council's executive member for finance, Alan Law, said: 'We are all obliged to pay council tax to cover the cost of numerous essential services and it is totally unfair for some people to think that this shared responsibility does not apply to them. 'I hope that this sentence gives a clear message that expecting others to pay will not be tolerated.' Campaigners insisted Mrs Buckle was a civilian, not a criminal, who had been held in unlawful custody. An online petition calling for her release garnered 1,671 signatures.

A West Berkshire Council spokesman said they had simply brought the case forward to try to retrieve the money and the court decided the sentence.

Speaking ahead of Mrs Buckle's release, her spokesman said: 'We have been invited to turn up with cash at the prison and pay Carla's council tax bill to them directly - and she will be released immediately. 'How utterly ridiculous in 2014 - we still have the Poor Laws in operation and debtors' private prisons. 'It's completely against Carla's human and constitutional rights to be jailed for a debt she cannot afford and has no contract for.' Writing on Facebook, Mrs Buckle thanked her supporters and said she was grieving for her uncle who had passed away while she was behind bars. She said: 'To everyone that wrote to me and have sent me messages, I am not ignoring you and will get back to everyone in the near future and hope you understand that I am busy helping the heroes that put time and effort at the expense of pushing their own social lives aside for me and their sleep, to put a case together and get me out of hell.

    "article": "(CNN) -- China is rallying around fallen hurdler Liu Xiang Wednesday after he failed to make it past the first-round heat for a second consecutive Olympics. The sympathetic response was a stark contrast to the public outcry over his high-profile withdrawal from the Beijing 2008 Games. Liu knocked over the first hurdle, injuring his right ankle and inflaming an Achilles tendon injury that ruined his medal ambitions at the 2008 Games. Liu then hopped on his left foot down the remainder of the track in a symbolic completion of the race, pausing to kiss the final hurdle. \"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,\" said Feng Shuyong, the leader of the Chinese athletics team, in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. \"Winning is not so important, participation is what matters.\" \"We've all seen how hard it is for him. It is such a pity but his spirit is there,\" Feng continued. \"I think he made a lot of efforts over the past four years trying to do well. But in competitive sports, anything can happen.\" \"Liu's spirit and sportsmanship won praise, not only from Chinese sport officials and millions of Chinese, but also from his foreign friends and opponents,\" wrote Xinhua. Local newspapers in cities across China carried Liu's story on their front pages, urging fans to support the athlete as he struggles to recover from injury. \"It is time for him to take a good rest,\" wrote the Chongqing Morning Post. On the Sina Weibo microblogging platform, where Liu Xiang was the top trending term Wednesday, the topic page for the Liu Xiang hashtag included the subheading: \"Liu Xiang fell and lost his chance to qualify for the semi-final. Write one sentence to comfort him.\" All eyes in China were on Liu at the London Olympics Tuesday, as he sought to redeem himself after limping off the track at his first-round heat at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. The outpouring of sympathy toward Liu is a marked contrast to the sharp anger and widespread criticism lobbed at him at the Beijing Games. His abrupt withdrawal in what was China's most anticipated event brought his coach, fans, and reporters literally to tears in the stadium. Back then, Chinese fans denounced him as a \"coward\" who should have finished the match before quitting. Some complained that they had paid 20 times the retail price for tickets to see Liu compete in Beijing, and demanded a refund. China's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu's symbolic completion of the race, as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf. At 29, Liu is also not expected to compete in another Olympics. The Shanghai native shot to international stardom when he won a gold medal in the 110-metre hurdles at the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. His victory secured China its first men's track and field gold medal. After a 13-month recovery period, Liu returned to the track at the 2009 Shanghai Grand Prix, finishing in second place. He went on to place first in several 110-metre hurdles competitions, including the 2010 Asian Games, 2011 Asian Championships, and 2012 Diamond Leagues held in Oregon and Shanghai. His coach, Sun Haiping, told Xinhua on August 3 that Liu's Achilles tendon injury had flared up at his training camp in Germany ahead of the London Olympics, although he said they were confident it was under control.

The sympathetic response was a stark contrast to the public outcry over his high-profile withdrawal from the Beijing 2008 Games. Liu knocked over the first hurdle, injuring his right ankle and inflaming an Achilles tendon injury that ruined his medal ambitions at the 2008 Games. Liu then hopped on his left foot down the remainder of the track in a symbolic completion of the race, pausing to kiss the final hurdle. \"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,\" said Feng Shuyong, the leader of the Chinese athletics team, in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. \"Winning is not so important, participation is what matters.\" \"We've all seen how hard it is for him. It is such a pity but his spirit is there,\" Feng continued. \"I think he made a lot of efforts over the past four years trying to do well. But in competitive sports, anything can happen.\" \"Liu's spirit and sportsmanship won praise, not only from Chinese sport officials and millions of Chinese, but also from his foreign friends and opponents,\" wrote Xinhua. Local newspapers in cities across China carried Liu's story on their front pages, urging fans to support the athlete as he struggles to recover from injury. \"It is time for him to take a good rest,\" wrote the Chongqing Morning Post. On the Sina Weibo microblogging platform, where Liu Xiang was the top trending term Wednesday, the topic page for the Liu Xiang hashtag included the subheading: \"Liu Xiang fell and lost his chance to qualify for the semi-final. Write one sentence to comfort him.\" All eyes in China were on Liu at the London Olympics Tuesday, as he sought to redeem himself after limping off the track at his first-round heat at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. The outpouring of sympathy toward Liu is a marked contrast to the sharp anger and widespread criticism lobbed at him at the Beijing Games. His abrupt withdrawal in what was China's most anticipated event brought his coach, fans, and reporters literally to tears in the stadium. Back then, Chinese fans denounced him as a \"coward\" who should have finished the match before quitting. Some complained that they had paid 20 times the retail price for tickets to see Liu compete in Beijing, and demanded a refund. China's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu's symbolic completion of the race, as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf. At 29, Liu is also not expected to compete in another Olympics. The Shanghai native shot to international stardom when he won a gold medal in the 110-metre hurdles at the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. His victory secured China its first men's track and field gold medal. After a 13-month recovery period, Liu returned to the track at the 2009 Shanghai Grand Prix, finishing in second place. He went on to place first in several 110-metre hurdles competitions, including the 2010 Asian Games, 2011 Asian Championships, and 2012 Diamond Leagues held in Oregon and Shanghai. His coach, Sun Haiping, told Xinhua on August 3 that Liu's Achilles tendon injury had flared up at his training camp in Germany ahead of the London Olympics, although he said they were confident it was under control. Liu also pulled out of the London Diamond League in London in July, citing back problems. Chinese media reported that Liu will undergo surgery for his Achilles tendon at a London hospital Wednesday. At 12.91 seconds, Liu's performance in Athens is the fastest 110-metre Olympic record to date.

The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court. She is the third Czech woman, after Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotna, to claim the Wimbledon singles crown. Both were in the Royal Box to witness her triumph and Kvitova paid them both a compliment as she savored her victory. \"It's hard to find some words, to see the great players in the Royal Box,\" said Kvitova, the first left-hander since Navratilova in 1990 to win the title. \"It's very nice when they're watching me all the time and supporting me, it's great.\" Russia's Sharapova was bidding to repeat her success as 17-year-old in 2004, but despite breaking Kvitova in her very first service game was largely second-best against an opponent hitting with pace and accuracy. Eighth seed Kvitova, beaten in the semifinals by eventual winner Serena Williams last year, responded with two breaks of Sharapova's service to take the first set in 40 minutes. She immediately broke Sharapova at the start of the second set and appeared to be in control, but the fifth seed retrieved it to level at two games all. Sharapova looked to gain momentum but she surrendered her service again only to show great resilience to break back again. But it was her last glimpse of glory as Kvitova broke again for 4-3 to close on her maiden grand slam title. Serving for the championship at 5-4, Kvitova carved out three match points and clinched it with an ace, sinking to the turf in triumph. But in contrast, it was a bitter disappointment for Sharapova, who has battled back to the top of the game after serious shoulder surgery. \"It's great to be back at this stage and holding the runner-up plate -- but I wanted the big one today,\" said Sharapova. \"But it's something I want to be back for and holding again one day.\" Defending champion Rafael Nadal and new world No.1 Novak Djokovic contest the men's singles final Sunday.",

    "article": "(CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the Obama administration to release 28 videotapes purportedly showing forced feedings and other confinement measures of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba. Judge Gladys Kessler ruled Friday the tapes can be released with modifications -- such as blurring faces -- to address the government's concerns over identifying guards, uniforms, and written materials on walls. \"Given what is already available to the public and known to the detainees, it simply is not plausible to argue that release of the videos will give rise to an additional probability of harm by encouraging the development of FCE [forced cell extractions] countermeasures,\" Kessler said in the ruling. Lawyers for a Syrian man held at Guantanamo since 2002, whose approved release is still pending, were lobbying for the release of the videos ahead of a hearing scheduled for Monday.

In 1950 Bogart and Katherine Hepburn flew into Uganda together with a huge team from Hollywood to shoot the movie of the same name. The film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer, the captain of the African Queen - two totally different characters - who in true silver screen fashion end up falling in love despite the odds. Hepburn wrote a frothy account of the making of the African Queen, which was shot between Uganda and neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, subtitled 'How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Houston and almost lost my mind'. Based on a 1934 novel by C.S. Forester, the movie was set during First World War in German-occupied east Africa. Fan: Cam McLeay (left), owner of the African Queen, stands on his boat with his colleagues on the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . 'There were actually two of these boats, one of them was in Congo and this is the Nile's African Queen,' explained McLeay, who recounts his love affair with the Nile. 'I'm very attached to the Nile. I've travelled the full length of the river, from the Mediterranean to the source in Nyungwe,' the father of three recounted. 'I've been up and down the river for 16 years.' Back in the 1990s he set up a rafting company in Uganda's Jinja area, and then had an eco-lodge built on an island in the river. McLeay says he wants his projects to be sustainable - from both an economic and an environmental point of view.

McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu, where traditional Arabic-style sailing dhows with lateen sails are common. 'I was looking for an authentic African boat to run on the Nile and I was thinking of buying a Swahili dhow,' he recounted. 'Then this hotel owner said: 'Why don't you buy the African Queen? She's from Uganda!' A week later McLeay had gone to Nairobi and tracked down Yank Evans, a septuagenarian who explained how he had found the hull of the boat abandoned in northern Uganda's Murchison Falls national park 20 years earlier and had done it up. When he left Uganda for Kenya he brought the boat with him. Authentic: McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu . Another five years went by between the boat's return to the banks of the Nile and the start of services on the river.

In the movie, directed by John Huston and released in 1951, the boat was powered by a diesel engine that was made to look like a steam engine. But when Evans restored it he decided to fit a real steam engine and had one airfreighted from Britain.

Angel Quiles saw 21-year-old Susie Stone driving along a road in Dunedin, Florida at 10pm on Thursday when the driver of a jeep turned into her path without seeing her. Quiles, whose wife and unborn baby miraculously survived a car crash just weeks ago, said the woman was thrown into a ditch - and he knew he had to be there for someone else's loved one. He ran over to her side and prayed with her. Scroll down for video . Kindness of strangers: Angel Quiles, 35, saw a young woman being hit by a jeep last Thursday and ran to her side. She told him to tell her mother that she was going to be OK and to give her a hug . Loss: Susie Stone, 21, passed away on Thursday night after a driver failed to see her and knocked her down . 'All she said after I prayed with her was, \"Tell my mom I'm going to be OK, and give her a hug for me\",' Quiles, 35, told WPTV. 'I just began to cry when I saw her take her last breath,' he said, becoming emotional. On Friday, he met with Stone's heartbroken parents to comfort them and pass on her dying wish. 'I told her, \"Sorry, I wish I could have done more\",' said Quiles. 'She said that Susie's a beautiful girl who loved life.' Stone's mother said that she was glad her daughter had an angel by her side. Heartbreaking: Quiles gives Susie's devastated mother a hug - as the 21-year-old had asked . Sadness: Her mother and father (in white) broke down in tears as they prayed together on Friday . Just weeks before the tragic crash, Stone, a waitress and actress, had taken to her Facebook page to express her gratitude for life. 'I love life,' she wrote on October 25. 'And all involved. Music. People. Dancing. Coffee. Bad decisions. Good decisions. Perfect moments of synchronicity. 'I love me. I love all I've done this year. I love all the things I've lost. They've given me so much in return. Good \"morning\". It's a beautiful day out. And I'm feeling good.' The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged. The crash came just three weeks after Quiles' wife Jenny was struck by a tow truck as she crossed a road in St Petersburg to go to a doctor's appointment. Tragic: Quiles' wife Jenny, pictured together left, was herself hit by a truck last month but miraculously their unborn child survived. But Jenny is still battling a traumatic brain injury in hospital, right . Scene: Quiles returned to the ditch where he found Stone and recounted how he prayed with her . She was 33 weeks pregnant at the time but both she and her baby survived after she reportedly turned her body to protect her stomach. Two weeks later, the little girl, Emmi, was born early and has since gone home, but Quiles' wife remains in hospital for treatment for traumatic brain injury, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The driver, Shaun Downing, has been issued a traffic citation for failing to yield to a pedestrian and will have to pay a fine, but he did nothing criminal, investigators concluded. The Quiles family has set up a gofundme page to raise funds for Jenny's medical care. See below for video .",

Angel Quiles saw 21-year-old Susie Stone driving along a road in Dunedin, Florida at 10pm on Thursday when the driver of a jeep turned into her path without seeing her. Quiles, whose wife and unborn baby miraculously survived a car crash just weeks ago, said the woman was thrown into a ditch - and he knew he had to be there for someone else's loved one. He ran over to her side and prayed with her. Scroll down for video . Kindness of strangers: Angel Quiles, 35, saw a young woman being hit by a jeep last Thursday and ran to her side. She told him to tell her mother that she was going to be OK and to give her a hug . Loss: Susie Stone, 21, passed away on Thursday night after a driver failed to see her and knocked her down . 'All she said after I prayed with her was, \"Tell my mom I'm going to be OK, and give her a hug for me\",' Quiles, 35, told WPTV. 'I just began to cry when I saw her take her last breath,' he said, becoming emotional. On Friday, he met with Stone's heartbroken parents to comfort them and pass on her dying wish. 'I told her, \"Sorry, I wish I could have done more\",' said Quiles. 'She said that Susie's a beautiful girl who loved life.' Stone's mother said that she was glad her daughter had an angel by her side. Heartbreaking: Quiles gives Susie's devastated mother a hug - as the 21-year-old had asked . Sadness: Her mother and father (in white) broke down in tears as they prayed together on Friday . Just weeks before the tragic crash, Stone, a waitress and actress, had taken to her Facebook page to express her gratitude for life. 'I love life,' she wrote on October 25. 'And all involved. Music. People. Dancing. Coffee. Bad decisions. Good decisions. Perfect moments of synchronicity. 'I love me. I love all I've done this year. I love all the things I've lost. They've given me so much in return. Good \"morning\". It's a beautiful day out. And I'm feeling good.' The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged. The crash came just three weeks after Quiles' wife Jenny was struck by a tow truck as she crossed a road in St Petersburg to go to a doctor's appointment. Tragic: Quiles' wife Jenny, pictured together left, was herself hit by a truck last month but miraculously their unborn child survived. But Jenny is still battling a traumatic brain injury in hospital, right . Scene: Quiles returned to the ditch where he found Stone and recounted how he prayed with her . She was 33 weeks pregnant at the time but both she and her baby survived after she reportedly turned her body to protect her stomach. Two weeks later, the little girl, Emmi, was born early and has since gone home, but Quiles' wife remains in hospital for treatment for traumatic brain injury, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The driver, Shaun Downing, has been issued a traffic citation for failing to yield to a pedestrian and will have to pay a fine, but he did nothing criminal, investigators concluded. The Quiles family has set up a gofundme page to raise funds for Jenny's medical care. See below for video .\"",

    "article": "Turkey's lawmakers voted Thursday to authorize military force against the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq, opening the door to cooperation with a U.S.-led coalition going after ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to a U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. The mood of Turkey's leaders changed in recent days, with ISIS on the nation's doorstep and tens of thousands fleeing across its border. The Prime Minister asked Parliament to consider military action this week, submitting a motion declaring that Turkey was seriously threatened by the chaos in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS has captured land and is trying to establish an Islamic caliphate. For months, ISIS has been advancing, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. The fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days, with ISIS advancing and nearly surrounding the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab, just a few miles from the border with Turkey. If ISIS takes Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. Residents told to evacuate . Residents in Kobani were ordered to evacuate Thursday by the local defense force, the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), as ISIS advanced on three fronts, seizing a number of villages just outside the city, Mustafa Abdi, a media activist in the city, told CNN. Abdi said he was waiting at the border at Mursitpinar with approximately 3,000 people waiting to cross into Turkey. Saroat Saeed, a university student, said he had made it across the border after waiting with what he said were the last civilians to leave Kobani. Only fighters trying to defend the city now remain, he said, but it is surrounded by ISIS and they face a dire situation. Alan Minbic, a YPG fighter, said Kobani had now been declared a military zone by the Kurdish force's leaders. ISIS has Kobani surrounded from three sides and its fighters are positioned very close to the city, he said. Kurdish snipers have taken up positions on high ground around the city but can expect ISIS shelling to try to dislodge them, he said. The YPG is now expecting ISIS to try to enter the city itself, Minbic said, adding that guerrilla warfare is the best chance for the defenders of Kobani because they hold the city and know it well. 'We are not afraid to die' Another YPG fighter who gave only his first name, Botan, said from Kobani that the Kurdish forces were determined to fight on. \"ISIS has surrounded us but we will fight, we are keeping our morale high,\" he said. \"We know, we have also seen, what ISIS is capable of, what brutality they can do. ... We know what they can do but we are not afraid to die, we are not afraid to fight. We know what will happen if ISIS takes over our town and what they will do to us.\" The fighters will resist neighborhood by neighborhood, he said. \"Our fight is not just for the Kurds, it is a fight for all of humanity. When people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals, it is a duty to fight.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that clashes had been reported between YPG and ISIS fighters only a few hundred yards from the east and southeast of the city. ISIS militants have seized more than 350 villages in the past 16 days and displaced no fewer than 300,000 people from Kobani and the surrounding countryside, it said. Many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the United States and its coalition partners paid to helping the Kurdish fighters in Kobani hold off ISIS. On Twitter, people are using hashtags #ObamaHearKobani and #SaveKobani as part of an effort to raise the question. There was at least one airstrike near Kobani on Thursday by the coalition, according to the U.S. military. The strike targeted an ISIS checkpoint near the town, the military said. Turkey's decision on military action came a day after newly appointed NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg stressed at his first news conference that the defense alliance was committed to protecting Turkey if it comes under attack. Special forces deployed . A possible threat to an ancient tomb -- located in Syria but considered a Turkish enclave -- also appeared to be a factor in Turkey's decision to approve going after ISIS. Reports had emerged that ISIS surrounded  the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed reports that ISIS had surrounded the site. But the debate in Parliament mentioned  increasing security risks to the white marble mausoleum. As part of the Treaty of Ankara in 1921, which ended the Franco-Turkish War, Turkey was allowed to keep the tomb despite its location in Syria, to place guards at it and to raise a Turkish flag over it. Opinion: Will Turkish boots on ground really defeat ISIS? There have been conflicting reports in recent days about what has happened at the tomb and its guards, with some claims emerging that ISIS fighters briefly took the guards captive. It has also been widely reported that ISIS has had the tomb surrounded for months. So valued is the tomb said to contain the remains of Suleyman Shah -- grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire -- that Turkey deployed special forces soldiers in March when ISIS began to take villages and towns surrounding the tomb. Allen: 'Important moment' for anti-ISIS coalition . U.N. report details abuses . While Turkey approved the use of military action against ISIS, a new United Nations report outlined \"a staggering array\" of human rights abuses committed by ISIS in Iraq over a nine-week period, including executions, killings, rape and the desecration of religious sites. The report documents \"acts of violence of an increasingly sectarian nature\" by ISIS and associated armed groups and says their abuses appear to be widespread and systematic. From women reportedly being shot in the head for refusing to treat ISIS fighters, to the execution of Sunnis who refused to swear allegiance to ISIS, to the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque, it's a litany of horrors. Produced jointly by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the report covers the period from July 6 to September 10, when ISIS was advancing across a swath of northern Iraq. The abuses \"include attacks directly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, executions and other targeted killings of civilians, abductions, rape and other forms of sexual and physical violence perpetrated against women and children, forced recruitment of children, destruction or desecration of places of religious or cultural significance, wanton destruction and looting of property, and denial of fundamental freedoms,\" the report said.

    "article": "(CNN) -- So, that happened. Fresh on the heels of the infamous Red Wedding, Sunday's \"Game of Thrones\" served up more murderous matrimony. But, with what fans have dubbed the \"Purple Wedding,\" many of us finally got something we'd been hoping for since season one. As the loathsome King Joffrey lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of Violet Beauregarde from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives: Who did it? Certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic, smug boy king. Here, we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed. Let us know your theory in the comments (and, book readers, no spoilers, please!) Tyrion . He's obviously Cersei's top suspect. And it's not like he doesn't have reasons. There was no love lost between Tyrion and his nephew (remember the much-celebrated slap?) even before Joffrey went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly, both before and after the wedding. Slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book? Check. Wine on the head? Check. Trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast? Check. Was it all just too much for Tyrion? Not hard to imagine. Sansa . And then there's Tyrion's wife. Joffrey was responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and brother. And that's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage. (Not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point.) Sansa may be as close to an innocent as still exists in King's Landing. But what better time than Joffrey's wedding day to exact some revenge? Oberyn Martell . \"The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\" When the Martells sent fiery warrior Oberyn to the wedding in place of his brother, Prince Doran, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they haven't forgotten, or forgiven, that Oberyn's sister, Elia, was raped and killed by Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane, who serves the Lannisters. It only took hearing a Lannister song, \"The Rains of Castamere,\" to send Oberyn into an anti-Lannister stabbing fit at a brothel. Was murdering Joffrey his plan all along? The Tyrells . The wedding was over. Margaery was a queen. But Margaery and the rest of the Tyrell family, particularly Margaery's grandmother Olenna, had no doubts about what a rotten little bastard (literally) Joffrey was. It's possible they've concocted a scheme to off Joffrey, but still press their claim for the Iron Throne now that Margaery has a crown on her head. Stannis and Melisandre . As Jaime told Joffrey, the war is not over. We assume Joffrey's transition to a lovely shade of purple was due to poisoning. But could it have been more dark magic from the Red Priestess instead? It's easy to focus on the people who were at the wedding. But we've already seen what Melisandre can do to a foe without having to be in his presence. Could this have been an otherworldly announcement that Stannis is down, but not out? Somebody else? Seriously, who doesn't have one reason or another to want Joffrey dead? Lord Varys isn't called \"The Spider\" for nothing. He's sneaky, as well as professing to be the only person in Westeros who truly wants what's best for the kingdom. He could have decided that's not Joffrey. Knight-turned-fool Ser Dontos was obviously up to something. Was this part of a plan to save Sansa and avenge his humbling by Joffrey? It's hard to imagine how Daenerys could have played a part from across the Narrow Sea. But could someone loyal to the Targaryens have made a move to weaken the Lannisters' hold on the throne? We can presume it will all become clear in time. Meanwhile, we'll make a mental note to never, ever, accept a wedding invitation in Westeros.",

Your summary must be strictly factual, concise, and limited to what is directly stated in the article:\n\n\"(CNN) -- So, that happened. Fresh on the heels of the infamous Red Wedding, Sunday's \"Game of Thrones\" served up more murderous matrimony. But, with what fans have dubbed the \"Purple Wedding,\" many of us finally got something we'd been hoping for since season one. As the loathsome King Joffrey lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of Violet Beauregarde from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives: Who did it? Certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic, smug boy king. Here, we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed. Let us know your theory in the comments (and, book readers, no spoilers, please!) Tyrion . He's obviously Cersei's top suspect. And it's not like he doesn't have reasons. There was no love lost between Tyrion and his nephew (remember the much-celebrated slap?) even before Joffrey went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly, both before and after the wedding. Slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book? Check. Wine on the head? Check. Trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast? Check. Was it all just too much for Tyrion? Not hard to imagine. Sansa . And then there's Tyrion's wife. Joffrey was responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and brother. And that's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage. (Not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point.) Sansa may be as close to an innocent as still exists in King's Landing. But what better time than Joffrey's wedding day to exact some revenge? Oberyn Martell . \"The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\" When the Martells sent fiery warrior Oberyn to the wedding in place of his brother, Prince Doran, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they haven't forgotten, or forgiven, that Oberyn's sister, Elia, was raped and killed by Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane, who serves the Lannisters. It only took hearing a Lannister song, \"The Rains of Castamere,\" to send Oberyn into an anti-Lannister stabbing fit at a brothel. Was murdering Joffrey his plan all along? The Tyrells . The wedding was over. Margaery was a queen. But Margaery and the rest of the Tyrell family, particularly Margaery's grandmother Olenna, had no doubts about what a rotten little bastard (literally) Joffrey was. It's possible they've concocted a scheme to off Joffrey, but still press their claim for the Iron Throne now that Margaery has a crown on her head. Stannis and Melisandre . As Jaime told Joffrey, the war is not over. We assume Joffrey's transition to a lovely shade of purple was due to poisoning. But could it have been more dark magic from the Red Priestess instead? It's easy to focus on the people who were at the wedding. But we've already seen what Melisandre can do to a foe without having to be in his presence. Could this have been an otherworldly announcement that Stannis is down, but not out? Somebody else? Seriously, who doesn't have one reason or another to want Joffrey dead? Lord Varys isn't called \"The Spider\" for nothing. He's sneaky, as well as professing to be the only person in Westeros who truly wants what's best for the kingdom. He could have decided that's not Joffrey. Knight-turned-fool Ser Dontos was obviously up to something. Was this part of a plan to save Sansa and avenge his humbling by Joffrey? It's hard to imagine how Daenerys could have played a part from across the Narrow Sea. But could someone loyal to the Targaryens have made a move to weaken the Lannisters' hold on the throne? We can presume it will all become clear in time. Meanwhile, we'll make a mental note to never, ever, accept a wedding invitation in Westeros.\"",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel to reconsider long-term plans to build more than 20,000 units, according to a press release from Netanyahu's office. \"This step does not contribute to settlement,\" the statement said. \"On the contrary, there is damage here for settlement.\" \"This is a meaningless step -- legally and in practice -- and an action that creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with Iran.

    "article": "Tory MP Peter Bone, who is a fierce critic of UK aid policy, branded the legal action as 'bizarre' and 'ridiculous' An Ethiopian farmer has won permission to use taxpayers’ money to sue the British Government ... for sending aid to his homeland. The case, branded ridiculous by MPs, will be funded entirely by the public even though the farmer has never set foot in this country. The 33-year-old Ethiopian – granted anonymity to protect his family – says ministers are funding a one-party state in his country that has breached his human rights. He says foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘brutal treatment’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land, against the International Development Act 2002. Taxpayers will pay for both the farmer’s lawyers and a defence team from the Department for International Development, in a case that could cost tens of thousands of pounds. This is in addition to the £1.3billion Britain has sent to Ethiopia since 2010. The farmer lodged the court papers from Kenya, before Justice Secretary Chris Grayling introduced rules to prevent cases being brought by those who have never set foot in the UK. The changes, which come into force next month, will mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in Britain for at least 12 months. A Whitehall source said: ‘Whatever hardships this man has faced, the idea that someone without any connection to this country can get public money to sue the Government borders on the farcical.’ Tory MP Peter Bone, a fierce critic of UK aid policy, said the legal action was ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘This is a ridiculous case and it is ridiculous there is legal aid for it.’ However, he added: ‘If money is going to a corrupt regime and somebody is pointing that out then we should be taking note of it. That is the problem. A lot of the money goes on propping up corrupt regimes.’ It is not clear how the farmer, a father of six identified only as O, came to bring the case. Papers lodged earlier this year state he had to leave his family and flee to a refugee camp in Kenya after being beaten and tortured trying to protect his land. The UK has contributed to a £510million Protection of Basic Services fund which has allegedly ‘contributed’ to the programme of displacing the farmers. O is not personally seeking compensation, but wants the Government to change its aid policies and stop bankrolling brutal regimes. If he succeeds, ministers could be forced to review donations to other nations accused of atrocities, such as Pakistan and Rwanda. Leigh Day has earned vast sums in legal aid by bringing cases against the Government on behalf of overseas clients. Last year the firm won compensation worth almost £20million for 5,200 Kenyans who were tortured and abused during the Mau Mau rebellion in the Fifties and Sixties. It is also heavily involved in the Al Sweady Inquiry, examining claims that troops executed and tortured Iraqis at a camp near Basra in 2004. The hearings have already cost taxpayers £27million, despite evidence linking the men to a ‘terrorist organisation’. Ethiopia is Africa’s oldest independent country. Apart from a five-year occupation by Mussolini’s Italy, it has never been colonised. Drought, war and famine brought millions to the brink of starvation in the Eighties. This inspired rock stars to launch Band Aid. Now led by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, its economy has grown rapidly since civil war ended in 1993. However, it is still one of Africa’s poorest states, with its population of  86.5million earning an average of just £240 a year. O is being represented by Rosa Curling of Leigh Day. Her law firm has already brought a string of human rights-based legal aid cases against the State on behalf of overseas claimants who say they have suffered ill-treatment due to government policies. Ministers had urged the High Court to reject the latest claim, but Mr Justice Warby said yesterday it was ‘reasonable’ for O to believe there was a link between the Department for International development handing aid to Ethiopia and alleged human rights abuses. He said O may launch a judicial review to argue the department had ‘failed to have in place any sufficient process to assess Ethiopia’s compliance with the express conditions for receiving UK aid – or to follow such process’. International Development Secretary Justine Greening, who is named as the respondent on the court papers, denies the claims.

One entry was said to read: ‘God doesn’t give a f***. Protect yourself from this. Remember Jocelyn Stone. 'God let her take the p***.’ Other notes mentioned the need to buy a semi-automatic gun, a gun holder, a silencer and infra-red equipment, as well as a ‘ninja sword’, it was said.

The Healthy Diet Study 2014, by Galaxy Research, has exposed the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets, which can restrict nutrients and vitamins needed for ideal psychological development.

Scroll down for video . The Healthy Diet Study 2014 , led Galaxy Research, exposes the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets for children . The research found that a further 45 per cent of these parents limited the bread their children ate, and 17 per cent cut carbs from their children’s diet altogether. Popular diets such as paleo and clean-eating have seen a marked drop in carbohydrate intake among Australians, which can lead to a deficient intake of fibre, grains and protein. Sydney based paediatric dietician Hanan Salah told Daily Mail Australia she condemns restrictive low carbohydrate diets for children. ‘There are often overweight or obese parents who try to cut out food groups. In doing so, they put their children on these restrictive diets,’ she said. ‘Carbohydrates are essential to the brain function of children at school, as well as maintainingenergy levels. Carbohydrates also release serotonin, so restricting this can result in a drop in mood, and even the potential for depression in the long term.’ Ms Salah said that while the diets can lead to weight loss in overweight children, they will miss out on essential nutrients such as fibre and other vitamins.

A graffiti artist painted a memorial to Leon Bartholomew who died from a rare form of cancer . A graffiti artist has paid tribute to a two-year-old boy who died from a rare form of cancer by spray painting the toddler's face onto a 30ft memorial wall. Scott Vincent spent two days painting the skate park mural in honour of little Leon Bartholomew, who lost a six month battle against the disease. It shows the cartoon-mad youngster with Mickey Mouse ears and has been described as a 'shrine' by his grieving father Daniel, 25. Family and friends have flocked to the wall in his hometown of New Milton, Hampshire, to lay flowers, light candles and add messages. Leon was diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, which caused tumours to form his lungs and brain. Mr Bartholomew was touched when Mr Vincent travelled from his home in Brighton, East Sussex, to commemorate Leon's life. He described the finished work as a 'perfect picture' of his son. The former warehouse worker, who had to quit his job when Leon fell ill, said: 'The whole family was warmed when we saw the wall for the first time. 'We were all devastated when Leon passed away after battling a rare form of cancer for six months. 'But the wall is the a great way to remember our son and people have treated it with respect - it's just like a shrine.'

    "article": "The United States has increased its military presence in Iraq, ordering 300 more troops to the violence-ravaged nation, the Pentagon announced Monday. ISIS militants have \"continued to pose a legitimate threat to Baghdad and its environs,\" a U.S. official told CNN. \"We have seen them reinforce themselves around Baghdad enough to convince us more troops was the prudent thing to do.\" The new troops, 200 of whom arrived Sunday and Monday, will provide security for the U.S. Embassy, the Baghdad airport and other facilities in Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The deployment includes \"a detachment of helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, which will bolster airfield and travel route security,\" Kirby said in a written statement. The airport is in western Baghdad about 12 miles (20 kilometers) by helicopter from the embassy in the capital's fortified Green Zone. The 300 troops are in addition to 300 U.S. advisers who will help train Iraq's security forces. They will bring the total of American forces in Iraq to about 800 troops. Revered Shiite shrine attacked . On Monday, Three mortar rounds hit the outer gate of a Shiite holy site in Samarra, killing one person and wounding 14, a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said. Al-Iraqiya, a state-run television network, reported that the Iraqi air force demolished the site where the mortars were fired. The Al-Askariya mosque was heavily damaged by militants in February 2006. That attack triggered retaliatory attacks against Sunnis, and touched off the sectarian fighting that nearly tore the country apart. The mosque houses the Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari shrine, one of the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims. Samarra is about  80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The death was one of 1,873 in June due to violence, according to the Interior Ministry, a figure that includes 355 Iraqi soldiers and 130 police officers. That is a dramatic increase from the May death toll of 994 given by the United Nations and health officials in restive Anbar province. The U.N. said 144 of the people killed in May were civilian police officers. ISIS declares caliphate . Emboldened by a weakened Iraqi government that is struggling to stop their murderous advance, extremists of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria declared over the weekend that they have set up a caliphate spanning large areas of the two countries. In a newly released audio message and written statement, purportedly from the official spokesman of ISIS, the group called on Muslims to swear allegiance to the caliphate, which means Islamic state. The group said in the message Sunday, which CNN couldn't independently confirm, that its flag now flies from Aleppo province in northwestern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq. It announced that it was changing its name to just the \"Islamic State.\" The ISIS statement was just one of the many developments in the fast-moving situation in Iraq over the weekend. How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda . Who controls Tikrit? Iraq's government touted its military offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists, with some officials taking to state-run television over the weekend to declare that the army had defeated ISIS. But residents in the city nestled along the Tigris River, about 140 kilometers (about 87 miles) northwest of Baghdad, gave a different account Sunday. \"There are no Iraqi troops here,\" one woman told CNN by telephone from Tikrit. The only presence, at least in her neighborhood, is the \"Islamic state,\" she said, referring to ISIS. The woman, who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety, said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle, in the form of shelling, being carried out by both sides. Heavy shelling . A video posted on YouTube appears to support her assertion. A man gives a tour of the city to show, he says, that there were no Iraqi security forces on the streets on Saturday, the day Iraqi forces said they launched the offensive. In the video, the man can be heard repeatedly saying \"June 28, 2014,\" presumably to offer evidence of the date. He says \"Thank God, Tikrit is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of 'al-Haliki,' \" a derogatory reference to al-Maliki that refers to his death. Witnesses inside and outside Tikrit said Iraqi forces were heavily shelling the city. Two days ago, the air force dropped leaflets from helicopters, demanding that residents leave the city \"for their safety.\" A large number of people have fled Tikrit for smaller villages to the north, according to witnesses, who say Iraqi forces are battling ISIS on the southern edge of the city. State-run Iraqi TV showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city. Another video, released by the Ministry of Defense, showed Iraqi troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert. The video was titled \"cleansing the road between Samarra and Tikrit.\" CNN couldn't independently confirm the different claims. Russian jets arrive . Five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets have arrived in Iraq, the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract between Moscow and Baghdad, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said in a statement. A video the ministry released Monday showed the jets, with wings unattached, being pulled toward hangars. \"These jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism,\" the ministry said. The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime. The announcement follows a comment by al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. \"I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract\" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. \"God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,\" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s \"weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,\" Kirby said. \"And we were in the process of working towards that delivery.\" The advance of the al Qaeda splinter group \"couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,\" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. Mass graves reported . Human Rights Watch has reported the discovery in Tikrit of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by ISIS and its militant allies. In addition to the alleged executions in Tikrit, reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides. Human Rights Watch, citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists, said Saturday that ISIS fighters kidnapped at least 40 Shiite Turkmens, dynamited four Shiite places of worship and ransacked homes and farms in two villages just outside Mosul. The few Sunni villagers who remained in Guba and Shireekhan told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped Turkmens had been killed, the rights group said. However, they had not seen bodies and could not give more information. ISIS destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shiite Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Mosul, earlier in the week, Human Rights Watch added, citing local sources. But the allegations of atrocities are not just limited to ISIS. Amnesty International has said it has gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of \"extrajudicial executions\" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba.

    "article": "(CNN) -- Betty Ford, the widow of late President Gerald Ford and a co-founder of an eponymous addiction center in California, has died at the age of 93, according to the director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. Ford died Friday evening with family at her bedside, according to a family member. Elaine Didier, the director of the Grand Rapids, Michigan, museum, confirmed Ford's death to CNN. No other details were immediately available. The family is expected to release a statement later Friday or Saturday, Didier said. Condolences began pouring in soon after news broke about her death -- including from celebrities who sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center. \"As far as I'm concerned, Betty Ford saved my life,\" Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks said. Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, who revealed in his recent autobiography that he was treated at the Betty Ford Center for drug addiction, also praised Ford's work. \"Betty Ford took a risk at one of the worst times of her life and came forward to share a message of recovery in order to serve others,\" Tyler said. \"Her vision, passion and amazing heart led to the Betty Ford Center, the gold standard of treatment facilities. She will be missed, but her work in recovery will live on.\" President Barack Obama remembered the former first lady as a \"powerful advocate for women's health and women's rights\" and someone who \"helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction.\" His predecessor, George W. Bush, added that \"because of her leadership, many lives were saved.\" Some of the many others offering praise and sympathy included Nancy Reagan (calling Ford \"an inspiration\"), and former presidents George H. W. Bush (describing her as a \"wonderful wife and mother, a great friend and a courageous first lady) and Jimmy Carter (saying she was \"a close personal friend\" and \"a remarkable political spouse.\") Born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in Chicago, she grew up in Grand Rapids. At the age of 21, she moved to New York City to work as a dancer and model. She returned to the Midwest two years later. One year after divorcing William Warren after five years of marriage, she wed Gerald Ford -- a former star football player at the University of Michigan, decorated U.S. Navy veteran and budding Republican politician -- in 1948. That year, the woman now known as Betty Ford campaigned with her new husband on his successful venture to become a U.S. congressman from Michigan. She gave birth to three sons and a daughter over the course of their 58-year marriage. The family moved to Washington, where Gerald Ford served in the Capitol for 25 years before being tapped in 1973 as then-President Richard Nixon's vice president in place of Spiro T. Agnew. Just over 10 months later, Betty Ford became first lady when her husband was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States. Gerald Ford took office after Nixon resigned in the wake of his pending impeachment following the crisis and cover-up of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Betty Ford soon made headlines, holding press conferences and publicly discussing her diagnosis with breast cancer. The first lady talked about abortion, pre-marital sex and equal rights in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in 1975 -- the same year Newsweek named her its \"Woman of the Year.\" According to the Ford library and museum's website, her candidness initially drew some criticism, but in a short time, 75% of Americans approved of her in public opinion polls. But in 1978, just over one year after leaving the White House after her husband lost his campaign to remain president, Ford made headlines of a different kind. She entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital to seek treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller abuse. That same year, she published the first of two autobiographies, entitled \"The Times of My Life.\" Ford would go on to become a high-profile example of someone who battled substance abuse issues and was a tireless advocate for drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment. \"My addiction was a combination of alcohol and the prescription drugs that ... both were a part of my life, but they did not become a problem until they overrode my common sense,\" Ford told CNN's Larry King in 2003. \"I didn't know what was happening, I just knew that I felt great and the pain was gone.\" Her work paid dividends in October 1982 when, along with Leonard Firestone, she opened the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. To this day, the center remains one of the most well-known and respected places nationwide for treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies. Ford also fought to promote awareness and research on breast cancer, with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation eventually naming an award in her honor.

Your summary must be strictly factual, concise, and limited to what is directly stated in the article:\n\n\"(CNN) -- Betty Ford, the widow of late President Gerald Ford and a co-founder of an eponymous addiction center in California, has died at the age of 93, according to the director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. Ford died Friday evening with family at her bedside, according to a family member. Elaine Didier, the director of the Grand Rapids, Michigan, museum, confirmed Ford's death to CNN. No other details were immediately available. The family is expected to release a statement later Friday or Saturday, Didier said. Condolences began pouring in soon after news broke about her death -- including from celebrities who sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center. \"As far as I'm concerned, Betty Ford saved my life,\" Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks said. Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, who revealed in his recent autobiography that he was treated at the Betty Ford Center for drug addiction, also praised Ford's work. \"Betty Ford took a risk at one of the worst times of her life and came forward to share a message of recovery in order to serve others,\" Tyler said. \"Her vision, passion and amazing heart led to the Betty Ford Center, the gold standard of treatment facilities. She will be missed, but her work in recovery will live on.\" President Barack Obama remembered the former first lady as a \"powerful advocate for women's health and women's rights\" and someone who \"helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction.\" His predecessor, George W. Bush, added that \"because of her leadership, many lives were saved.\" Some of the many others offering praise and sympathy included Nancy Reagan (calling Ford \"an inspiration\"), and former presidents George H. W. Bush (describing her as a \"wonderful wife and mother, a great friend and a courageous first lady) and Jimmy Carter (saying she was \"a close personal friend\" and \"a remarkable political spouse.\") Born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in Chicago, she grew up in Grand Rapids. At the age of 21, she moved to New York City to work as a dancer and model. She returned to the Midwest two years later. One year after divorcing William Warren after five years of marriage, she wed Gerald Ford -- a former star football player at the University of Michigan, decorated U.S. Navy veteran and budding Republican politician -- in 1948. That year, the woman now known as Betty Ford campaigned with her new husband on his successful venture to become a U.S. congressman from Michigan. She gave birth to three sons and a daughter over the course of their 58-year marriage. The family moved to Washington, where Gerald Ford served in the Capitol for 25 years before being tapped in 1973 as then-President Richard Nixon's vice president in place of Spiro T. Agnew. Just over 10 months later, Betty Ford became first lady when her husband was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States. Gerald Ford took office after Nixon resigned in the wake of his pending impeachment following the crisis and cover-up of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Betty Ford soon made headlines, holding press conferences and publicly discussing her diagnosis with breast cancer. The first lady talked about abortion, pre-marital sex and equal rights in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in 1975 -- the same year Newsweek named her its \"Woman of the Year.\" According to the Ford library and museum's website, her candidness initially drew some criticism, but in a short time, 75% of Americans approved of her in public opinion polls. But in 1978, just over one year after leaving the White House after her husband lost his campaign to remain president, Ford made headlines of a different kind. She entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital to seek treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller abuse. That same year, she published the first of two autobiographies, entitled \"The Times of My Life.\" Ford would go on to become a high-profile example of someone who battled substance abuse issues and was a tireless advocate for drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment. \"My addiction was a combination of alcohol and the prescription drugs that ... both were a part of my life, but they did not become a problem until they overrode my common sense,\" Ford told CNN's Larry King in 2003. \"I didn't know what was happening, I just knew that I felt great and the pain was gone.\" Her work paid dividends in October 1982 when, along with Leonard Firestone, she opened the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. To this day, the center remains one of the most well-known and respected places nationwide for treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies. Ford also fought to promote awareness and research on breast cancer, with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation eventually naming an award in her honor. She earned numerous honors over her life, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 and the Congressional Gold Medal eight years later.

Simon Brittle, 45, has been jailed for eight years after biting off his girlfriend's nose at a motorcycle rally . A biker who bit his girlfriend’s nose off leaving a 'gaping bloody hole' in what a judge described as a 'bestial' attack has been jailed for eight years. Simon Brittle, from Rotherham, bent down as if to kiss his girlfriend Heidi Smith’s nose but instead took a large bite, leaving her face pouring with blood. Hull Crown Court heard that Ms Smith, 44, from Nottingham, had a hole looking like 'half a ping-pong ball' where her nose used to be after the attack at a three-day motorcycle rally at South Dalton, near Beverley in East Yorkshire. She was rushed to hospital where plastic surgeons grafted skin from her hip on to her nose, but the court was told Miss Smith, a civil servant, was left with a 'pointy witch' appearance after reconstructive surgery. The attack happened at Motorcycle Action Group's Into the Valley Rally in May, and was witnessed by Sally Pearson, who told the court she could hear Miss Smith's screams above the loud music as she was pinned to the floor. She said she brushed Miss Smith’s hair away from her face and 'realised at once her nose was gone.' Ms Pearson added: 'Her nose was missing. There was a gaping bloody hole where her nose should have been.' The witness said she stayed with the distraught woman as she made a tearful call to her mother in Derbyshire to tell her a man had just bitten her nose off and she should come and pick up her motorcycle as she was on her way to hospital. The court heard that Brittle had been in a relationship with his victim for four months, and that it was a turbulent relationship that Miss Smith was too frightened to finish. Two days before the motorcycle event in the grounds of the Dalton estate, Brittle sent her a message on Facebook saying: 'I’m really looking forward to f****** you up over the weekend - take plenty of bodyguards. 'Here’s to a happy rally season. You don’t know what I am capable of.' Philip Evans, prosecuting, said that on the day of the attack Brittle became loud, drunk and aggressive, threatening to stab one man and accusing another of sleeping with Ms Smith. Heidi Smith, 44, says she has had to move from her home of 10 years because of the terrifying attack on her . He  then began punching and slapping her before twisting her arm, forcing her to the ground and straddling her. Mr Evans said: 'He pushed his thumb in her eye socket. 'That was painful, she screamed out for help, but other people thought it was a couple in an amorous embrace. 'But Sally Pearson heard a chilling scream. Others described it as blood-curdling. 'Sally Pearson took hold of Mr Brittle’s shoulder and shouted at him. The defendant was calm and Ms Pearson said he had a blank expression. 'She was told to get off. He lowered his head, as if they were going to kiss. Heidi Smith then let out an intense scream.' Ms Smith fell back on the floor holding her hands to her face in a pool of blood. Defence barrister John Thackray said: 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour. He is disgusted with himself. He was drunk. 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.  He is disgusted with himself.  He was drunk.' - Defence barrister John Thackray . 'He has gone from being a loyal partner, a good father and working man. 'There was a breakdown in the relationship. He lost his work, became a carer for his father and suffered from depression.' Sentencing Brittle, who admitted wounding with intent, Judge Mark Bury told him: 'The use of your teeth was plainly the use of a weapon. This was not just in public. This was in full view of Heidi Smith’s friends.' He jailed Brittle for eight years and imposed an indefinite restraining order on him contacting Miss Smith. Miss Smith has now had to move from the home she lived in for a decade as Brittle knew where where she lived. In a victim impact statement she said: 'I think it will be a long time before I can trust a man or be alone with them. 'I don't feel like me any more; I am embarrassed by this... I feel like people judge me' - Victim Heidi Smith, 44 . 'I don’t feel like me anymore; I am embarrassed by this. I have had to relive the incident over and over again as work colleagues asked me what happened. 'I have tried to ignore it, but it being my nose, I can’t hide it or cover it up.  I feel like people judge me and I think I have done something to deserve it. 'My family have been affected by this. My mother had to deal with me screaming down the telephone. I cannot imagine having a boyfriend again.' Four months after the May 4 attack , Miss Smith said she still had problems with her arm movement where Brittle had twisted it. She is also unable to pursue her hobbies of motorcycling and skiing because her nose is painful when she is cold. She added: 'I have to move from the home I have been in for 10 years.

Speaking to fellow CNN news anchor Brooke Baldwin, Ms Bash, 43, said she wasn't surprised 'in the least' to learn of New York senator Kristen Gillibrand's recent admission that she had been called 'porky' and 'fat' by male colleagues. 'After I had my son three years ago, I got some comments that would blow you away from male senators,' the political correspondent, based in Washington D.C. said. 'Talking about getting my figure back and things like that.' Scroll down for video . Weight jibes: Dana Bash, 43 (pictured), said that after she gave birth to her son, she received comments from male senators 'about getting my figure back' Although the mother-of-one declined to outline any further specifics, she remarked that these men maybe 'didn't realize' they were being inappropriate, and largely blames their age for the comments. '[Ms Gillibrand] mentions very clearly that these are law-makers in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and it is very much generational,' she agreed. 'I can't even think of one law-maker in either party, either chamber, who would do this who is maybe 50 years old or younger.' Ms Bash - who was recently honored by ELLE magazine as part of its annual Women in Washington Power List - mentioned that she had spoken 'in private' both to Ms Gillibrand and to other female members of congress about such matters.

She split with fellow CNN anchor John King in 2012, after less than four years of marriage and is now a single mother. Her comments come just days after Ms Gillibrand spoke openly of the sexism she has faced at various points in her political career.

    "article": "Alexis Sanchez believes he still has to improve despite an impressive start to his Barclays Premier League career - and insists Arsenal have the 'quality stars' needed to challenge for the title. The form of the Chile forward, signed from Barcelona in the summer for £32million, has been the one positive in an otherwise inconsistent opening by Arsene Wenger's side. Sanchez scored his 12th goal at Swansea on Sunday, when Arsenal again failed to hold onto a lead and were beaten 2-1, having thrown away a 3-0 advantage in the Champions League tie against Anderlecht. Alexis Sanchez believes he still has much to improve on despite a successful start to his Arsenal career . The Chilean (pictured celebrating after scoring against Swansea) has been a shining light for the Gunners . In a wide-ranging interview with AS Chile, the 25-year-old remains upbeat over the decision to leave Spain after the World Cup and that the Gunners can lift themselves back into contention after the international break. 'Little by little I am gaining confidence in my team-mates and am gradually learning more,' he said on www.chile.as.com. 'At first I had trouble understanding them, knowing where they ran, their movements, what gestures meant what, but every time I feel more confident. 'I am starting to memorise the moves of my team-mates and I learn to help them - clearly I need to improve and that is what I say in the dressing room, that I could stay a little less with the ball, play one touch play more often to facilitate counter-attacks, that is vital. 'I must learn that because the rapid transitions are key in this league and with this team.' While Sanchez concedes the English Premier League is 'the most complicated football and not easy' in comparison with the competitions back home and after subsequent moves to Italy with Udinese and then onto Barcelona, the diminutive forward insists he 'likes the challenge'. The Chile forward believes Arsenal have plenty of talent to come back to challenge leaders Chelsea and also progress in Europe. Sanchez is still adamant that Arsene Wenger's side can win any competition they enter . 'Now that I am here, sometimes I stop to look my team-mates during the training session and I realise that I am surrounded by a lot of quality stars,' he added. 'I have been impressed by their attitude and their talent. 'I love how they create spaces, their individual and collective movements. 'I tell you seriously: I like what I see so much that I have repeated myself many times, that if we have the required winning mentality, if we are positive and try to win every single game, I know we can win any competition. 'I know that with this team we can win many trophies in the coming years. I am convinced. 'I hope to win everything here. That's why I came.' Wenger has seen his side struggle to hold onto leads against Anderlecht and Swansea in recent weeks . Following defeat at Swansea, Arsenal find themselves in sixth place, four points behind Manchester City and already some 12 off Chelsea, who have yet to lose in their 11 league games. Like most of their rivals, the majority of the Gunners' squad are expected to be in action during the international break, with Theo Walcott back in the England fold after his recovery from a long-term knee injury, one of six Arsenal players who could feature at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday. France striker Olivier Giroud is on course to be closing in on an earlier than expected return from a broken bone in his foot. Wenger will be hoping centre-half Laurent Koscielny can be available again following treatment on his troublesome Achilles for the visit of Manchester United on November 22, having been forced to deploy Nacho Monreal at the heart of what has looked a very suspect makeshift defence in recent games.",

    "article": "The 2015 World Darts Championship is almost upon us with the festive fun set to commence at the Alexandra Palace in London on Thursday. Michael van Gerwen begins his defence of the title he won last year, but the likes of Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson are all hungry to wrestle the Sid Waddell Trophy away from the Dutchman. Twenty sessions of top tungsten spread over a 17-day period over Christmas and New Year will decide who is the best darts player on the planet, and here is our guide to the big tournament. Peter Wright, Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor get ready for the 2015 World Darts Championship . Taylor (left) and Van Gerwen (right) are the two favourites for the title at Alexandra Palace . The PDC tweeted a picture showing Alexandra Palace being set up for the tournament . VIDEO 2014 World Champs: Standout moments . Phil Taylor has more world titles, but I'll buy more houses... THE MAIN CONTENDERS . Michael van Gerwen . The reigning world champion and No 1 seed for this year's tournament, Van Gerwen is among the favourites to win the title again. Having been beaten by Taylor in the 2013 final, the Dutchman bounced back in 2014 to beat Peter Wright and lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. Van Gerwen has won the World Grand Prix and European Championship this year, and begins his title defence against Joe Cullen on the opening night at Alexandra Palace. Van Gerwen won his first world title last year (right) and will be looking to retain his crown . The Dutchman will play Joe Cullen on the opening night of the 2015 tournament at Alexandra Palace . VIDEO World Championship moments - Taylor v van Gerwen 2013 . Taylor's preparations overshadowed by illness to his mother . Phil Taylor . What more needs to be said about The Power than the fact he is a 16-time world champion? Taylor has accomplished everything in the game of darts and has nothing to prove. Taylor is the pre-tournament favourite at Alexandra Palace, and he begins his quest on Friday night against German Jyhan Artut. Taylor has had some personal issues to deal with leading up to the tournament with his mum Liz suffering from a lung infection. It remains to be seen how much his mum's illness affects his performance at Ally Pally. Taylor will enter the competition on Friday night when he faces German Jyhan Artut in the first round . The stage is set up at the Alexandra Palace in north London ahead of the tournament . 2014 - Michael van Gerwen . 2013 - Phil Taylor . 2012 - Adrian Lewis . 2011 - Adrian Lewis . 2010 - Phil Taylor . 2009 - Phil Taylor . 2008 - John Part . 2007 - Raymond van Barneveld . 2006 - Phil Taylor . 2005 - Phil Taylor . Adrian Lewis . Jackpot is a two-time world champion having won the title in both 2011 and 2012. But on both occasions since then, Lewis has run into a red-hot Van Gerwen, losing 5-4 in a thrilling quarter-final in 2013 and 6-0 in the semi-final 12 months ago. Lewis enters the tournament as the No 3 seed and opens his campaign against David Pallett. It's a tricky section of the draw he finds himself in, though, with potential matches with Raymond van Barneveld and Taylor on the way to the final. Gary Anderson . The Flying Scotsman has enjoyed a resurgence this year, entering the World Championship as the No 4 seed on the back of his win at the Players Championship, his first appearance in a premier event final for three years. Anderson took Ally Pally by storm in 2011 with his stunning scoring but came up short in the final, losing 7-5 to Lewis. But Anderson's life turned upside down soon after that when he lost both his brother Stuart and father Gordon in a short space of time. Anderson admitted that times were tough, but he seems to be back to his best on the oche now. Adrian Lewis won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012, but has been beaten by Van Gerwen both times since . Gary Anderson is returning to his best form this year and is one of the favourites for the title . Peter Wright . Having never previously been past the third round at the World Darts Championship, Wright produced a remarkable run all the way to the final in 2014. The man known as 'Snakebite' was eventually beaten by Van Gerwen in the final, but he won many admirers, not least for his extravagant hair styles and dress sense. Wright stunned everybody at Alexandra Palace last year when he made it all the way to the final . VIDEO 'Snakebite' prepares the hair . James Wade . Wade has won all there is to win in darts, apart from the world title. He has never even appeared in the final at Alexandra Palace, twice losing in the semi-finals. Wade may never get a better chance at the title than in 2012, when he was 5-1 up in the semi-final against Lewis and somehow lost 6-5. Still, his experience and performances this year make it hard to exclude him from the list of contenders for the title. Should he get past Jamie Lewis in the first round, a potential second-round clash with BDO world champion Stephen Bunting could await him. James Wade has won every major trophy in the PDC apart from the World Championship . Stephen Bunting . The winner of the BDO title last year makes his debut in the PDC version of the world championship this year. He made the switch from the BDO to the PDC in January and produced solid, if not spectacular, results, including making the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and the German Masters. Bunting is the sixth favourite for the tournament, as his lowly No 27 seeding means he could be facing No 6 seed Wade in the second round. Stephen Bunting will make his debut at Alexandra Palace having won the BDO world title last year . Raymond van Barneveld . It has been a long time since Barney produced his best at the World Championship. Since winning the 2007 world title, the best Van Barneveld has managed is a final appearance in 2009 and semi-final defeats in 2010 and 2013. Barney is seeded as low as 14, which means a potential third-round clash with Lewis awaits him. But if the Premier League champion finds his groove at the oche, he will be a tough man to beat.

    "article": "(CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain completed the signing of Brazilian international defender Alex from Chelsea Friday on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 29-year-old is re-united with PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was in charge at Chelsea when they won the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. He had fallen out of favor under Andre Villas-Boas and was also a target for fellow EPL side Queens Park Rangers, but chose the Parisian giants. \"I knew about PSG's immense stature and that made me want to come,\" Alex told the club's official website. \"For the past two months I've wanted to leave Chelsea and we finally opened talks with PSG. Everything went very well.\" Alex has won 18 Brazil caps and was in their squad which claimed the 2007 Copa America, but he will be battling five other players, including club captain Mamadou Sakho, for places in central defense. \"I know him very well. He's a fantastic man and a fantastic player. He's a good investment for the team,\" said Ancelotti. Ancelotti, who took charge in December, also revealed that the Qatari-backed club had ruled out an immediate move for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez. The Italian said they had been in discussions with Tevez and his connections but talks had broken down. \"We discussed a move with the player but there is ultimately no agreement,\" Ancelotti told the club website, but left the door open for a future deal. Meanwhile, Tevez's advisor Kia Joorabchian told British radio station TalkSport that it was likely the striker would stay at City until the summer. \"We've been in negotiations with three big clubs but I don't think they have reached the figures Manchester City want,\" Joorabchian claimed. Joorabchian also said he believed his player could end up at PSG next season. \"PSG want to build a long-term project and I think Carlos is six months too early for them. But there is a big chance he will go there in the summer,\" he added.",

The 29-year-old is re-united with PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was in charge at Chelsea when they won the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. He had fallen out of favor under Andre Villas-Boas and was also a target for fellow EPL side Queens Park Rangers, but chose the Parisian giants. \"I knew about PSG's immense stature and that made me want to come,\" Alex told the club's official website. \"For the past two months I've wanted to leave Chelsea and we finally opened talks with PSG. Everything went very well.\" Alex has won 18 Brazil caps and was in their squad which claimed the 2007 Copa America, but he will be battling five other players, including club captain Mamadou Sakho, for places in central defense. \"I know him very well. He's a fantastic man and a fantastic player. He's a good investment for the team,\" said Ancelotti. Ancelotti, who took charge in December, also revealed that the Qatari-backed club had ruled out an immediate move for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez. The Italian said they had been in discussions with Tevez and his connections but talks had broken down. \"We discussed a move with the player but there is ultimately no agreement,\" Ancelotti told the club website, but left the door open for a future deal. Meanwhile, Tevez's advisor Kia Joorabchian told British radio station TalkSport that it was likely the striker would stay at City until the summer. \"We've been in negotiations with three big clubs but I don't think they have reached the figures Manchester City want,\" Joorabchian claimed. Joorabchian also said he believed his player could end up at PSG next season. \"PSG want to build a long-term project and I think Carlos is six months too early for them. But there is a big chance he will go there in the summer,\" he added.\"",

The father of the children apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. Ms Murray appeared disheveled as she was arraigned in Uxbridge District Court on Friday morning. The judge agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance on reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month. Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, pointing to the conditions in the home, suggested that his client was mentally ill. She was held without bail, NECN reported and is due back in court on October 14.

Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in 'deplorable condition.' He said authorities don't know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. The body of one infant was found inside a closet, police said. The two other babies were found on Thursday. Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment on Friday. She is being held without bail and is due back in court on October 14 . The infants were found dead inside the home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Thursday where four children were removed by authorities last month . Prosecutors said Murray, 31, would be arraigned on Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney. A spokesman for the Blackstone Police Chief  told the Boston Globe today that Murray is believed to be the mother of all seven children. The search of the home, which is just a couple hundred feet away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days. The four other children, ages 13, ten, three and six months old, were removed from the house on August 28 after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions. The prosecutor said one of them approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn't stop crying. Early said the six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed.

Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits. 'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . An official described the interior of the home crawling with vermin, swarming with flies and covered in dirty diapers . The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in. 'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said. Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children. The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect. Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'. Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police. He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed. The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody.

We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . An official described the interior of the home crawling with vermin, swarming with flies and covered in dirty diapers . The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in. 'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said. Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children. The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect. Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'. Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police. He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed. The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody. On Thursday, 31-year-old Erika Murray was arrested in connection with the appalling living condition but not over the children's deaths. Murray is facing several charges, including witness intimidation. She will be arraigned on Friday.\"",

Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan. (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start. His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy. That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward. Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral. With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help? Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together. Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women. No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences. Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing. Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies. There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions. Still, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States. To start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the \"Muslim world\" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea. Turkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices. Anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran.",

    "article": "(CNN) -- Police say a young man who went on a rampage at a shopping mall in Columbia, Maryland, was so obsessed with the April 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that he dressed up in an outfit reminiscent of those shooters and took a picture of himself. The shooter, 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar, uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site Tumblr before the incident, police said Wednesday. The photo was taken in the dressing room of the The Mall in Columbia store where Aguilar would commit his crimes. In late January, Aguilar fatally shot Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, and injured a third person before turning the gun on himself. Police declined to release the photo, saying they believe Aguilar took it to gain notoriety and they won't honor that desire. Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said a message accompanying the picture read, in part; \"I had to do this.\" A police statement said Aguilar's account has been deactivated by Tumblr. Police verified previous reports that the shooter and the victims, one of whom worked at the skateboard apparel shop, were not acquainted. What was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe Aguilar had studied the Columbine shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there. \"Aguilar's weapon, attire, backpack containing explosives and method of suicide were all similar to those used in the Columbine incident, said a Howard County police statement. On April 20, 1999, two Columbine students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 of their classmates, a teacher and then themselves. The school is in Littleton, Colorado. McMahon said police have learned Aguilar began using the Internet last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools, gun laws and explosive techniques. He even downloaded a video game allowing players to act as one of the shooters from that day. Juxtaposed with those searches were inquiries about mental illness and visits to sites about suicide prevention. McMahon said Aguilar also sought help from his regular doctor because he said he was hearing voices. The doctor said he referred Aguilar to a psychiatrist, but it doesn't seem he ever made an appointment. The doctor told police Aguilar said those voices were non-violent and didn't direct him to do anything, authorities said. In December 2013, Aguilar purchased a shotgun at a shop just outside Washington, D.C. He was there with a friend, but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of Aguilar's future plans. Aguilar told his friend he was buying the gun for target practice. Police also recovered a journal which they said ultimately did not shed a lot of light on Aguilar's motives, but did give them some insight into his disturbed mind. In one entry, Aguilar wrote, \"I (sic) going to *expletive* kill you all in a couple of hours I'm anxious, I hate you all so much you are pathetic pieces of *expletive* who deserve to die. worthless you are all *expletive* worthless. Everything seems fake.

He had also researched mass shootings, gun laws, and explosives online, and had even downloaded a video game based on the Columbine shooting.",

Your summary must be strictly factual, concise, and limited to what is directly stated in the article:\n\n\"(CNN) -- Police say a young man who went on a rampage at a shopping mall in Columbia, Maryland, was so obsessed with the April 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that he dressed up in an outfit reminiscent of those shooters and took a picture of himself. The shooter, 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar, uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site Tumblr before the incident, police said Wednesday. The photo was taken in the dressing room of the The Mall in Columbia store where Aguilar would commit his crimes. In late January, Aguilar fatally shot Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, and injured a third person before turning the gun on himself. Police declined to release the photo, saying they believe Aguilar took it to gain notoriety and they won't honor that desire. Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said a message accompanying the picture read, in part; \"I had to do this.\" A police statement said Aguilar's account has been deactivated by Tumblr. Police verified previous reports that the shooter and the victims, one of whom worked at the skateboard apparel shop, were not acquainted. What was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe Aguilar had studied the Columbine shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there. \"Aguilar's weapon, attire, backpack containing explosives and method of suicide were all similar to those used in the Columbine incident, said a Howard County police statement. On April 20, 1999, two Columbine students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 of their classmates, a teacher and then themselves. The school is in Littleton, Colorado. McMahon said police have learned Aguilar began using the Internet last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools, gun laws and explosive techniques. He even downloaded a video game allowing players to act as one of the shooters from that day. Juxtaposed with those searches were inquiries about mental illness and visits to sites about suicide prevention. McMahon said Aguilar also sought help from his regular doctor because he said he was hearing voices. The doctor said he referred Aguilar to a psychiatrist, but it doesn't seem he ever made an appointment. The doctor told police Aguilar said those voices were non-violent and didn't direct him to do anything, authorities said. In December 2013, Aguilar purchased a shotgun at a shop just outside Washington, D.C. He was there with a friend, but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of Aguilar's future plans. Aguilar told his friend he was buying the gun for target practice. Police also recovered a journal which they said ultimately did not shed a lot of light on Aguilar's motives, but did give them some insight into his disturbed mind. In one entry, Aguilar wrote, \"I (sic) going to *expletive* kill you all in a couple of hours I'm anxious, I hate you all so much you are pathetic pieces of *expletive* who deserve to die. worthless you are all *expletive* worthless. Everything seems fake. I think that I may already be dead.\" Police said Aguilar fired a total of nine rounds, but came into the store with 54. \"Frankly, we're fortunate he took his own life rather than to run down the hallway and chase victims as they were leaving,\" McMahon told reporters.

Grainy CCTV footage in which a criminal’s face is obscured can make it difficult to identify perpetrators, and this job is even harder if no fingerprints are left at the scene. But, in what’s been dubbed a biometric breakthrough, researchers have discovered that a person’s body shape could equally give them away. Using just eight measurements, forensic teams were able to correctly identify people - even through clothes. Dubbed ‘body recognition’, the technique was developed at the University of Adelaide, and is said to be comparable with facial and fingerprint analysis. A team of researchers, led by PhD student Teghan Lucas, studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 US armed services personnel from a national database. In particular, they compared eight facial and eight body measurements to see if a person’s body shape could be used for identification. Measurements included overall height, length of the body from the hip bone to the feet, length of wrist to elbow, jaw line, pelvic width, chest width, the width of a person’s face, from ear to ear, and the skull. The breadth of hips across the 4,000 people studied varied by up to 5.9 inches (150mm), making an individual measurement more unique. But, the length of ears across the sample varied by just 1.3 inches (35mm), making them harder to distinguish between. Other measurements that can change, and were discounted in body recognition, include the width of the stomach, inner arm and calf. These areas are directly affected by weight gain and loss, for example. During tests, the results revealed that, compared with the face, fewer body measurements are needed to identify a person. ‘There's been a lot of work conducted over the years on facial recognition,’ said Ms Lucas. Measurements included height, length from hip to the feet, wrist to elbow, jaw line, pelvic width, chest width and the width of a person’s face, from ear to ear.

The researchers studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 US armed services personnel from a national database.

'What happens if identification of the face alone just isn't enough?’ She continued that the technique would prove particularly useful when trying to identify criminals, or missing persons, from CCTV footage, for example. ‘Measurements of the body, as well as the face, were used for forensic identification as early as the 19th century,' continued Ms Lucas. 'It was believed that no two individuals had the exact same measurements. ‘However, this was overtaken by fingerprint analysis because it was considered more reliable in court proceedings, and the probability of finding matching individuals could be easily calculated.’ Ms Lucas’ research discovered that, with a combination of eight body measurements, it is possible to reduce the probability of finding a duplicate to the order of one in a quintillion.

The larger measurements provided by the body compared to the face mean that there is more variation between people. ‘Despite what television and the movies would have people believe, there is often a lack of good quality video evidence,’ said Ms Lucas. ‘Criminal cases usually involve a deliberate attempt to cover the face, or fine details can't be seen. ‘In our experience, the body is more variable than the face and should be used in identification more often. ‘Another advantage to using the body is that larger dimensions are easier to locate on images and not affected by facial expressions.’",

The larger measurements provided by the body compared to the face mean that there is more variation between people. ‘Despite what television and the movies would have people believe, there is often a lack of good quality video evidence,’ said Ms Lucas. ‘Criminal cases usually involve a deliberate attempt to cover the face, or fine details can't be seen. ‘In our experience, the body is more variable than the face and should be used in identification more often. ‘Another advantage to using the body is that larger dimensions are easier to locate on images and not affected by facial expressions.’\"",
    "reply": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of the article:\nResearchers at the University of Adelaide have developed a new method of identification called \"body recognition\" that uses a combination of 8 body measurements to identify individuals, even when their face is obscured. The technique is comparable to facial and fingerprint analysis and has a probability of finding a duplicate of one in a quintillion. The method is particularly useful for identifying individuals from CCTV footage, as the body shape remains relatively unchanged over time and can be identified regardless of clothing.",

    "article": "A Quran teacher in central Somalia was the fifth beheading victim in one week at the hands of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia. \"The Quran teacher was snatched from his house in Qandho by Al-Shabaab militants on Friday and they dumped his headless, beheaded body near his home town on Saturday morning,\" local town spokesman Abdiaziz Durow told CNN. The teacher was identified as Mohamed Hussein, 45, a resident of the Qandho near the besieged town of Bulo Burde, 217 miles north of Mogadishu in central Somalia. \"The reason the Quran teacher was murdered is that he was one of the few residents that refused orders from Al-Shabaab to leave his village that was recently seized by Somali and AU troops,\" Durow said. Al-Shabaab had warned local residents to leave their houses in the towns they have seized, according to Durow. Last week, the militant group abducted and beheaded two Somali policewomen in the city of Teyeglow, located in the southwest region. The beheadings prompted a government soldier whose wife was among the victims to kill five Al-Shabaab wives in retaliation. Al-Shabaab also beheaded two government soldiers near the town of Bur Hakaba in the Bay region in south Somalia. Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state.

    "article": "(CNN) -- It has taken almost three months and more than 100 men embarking on a life-threatening hunger strike for President Obama to remind himself and the nation why the prison at Guantanamo Bay needs to be closed. Self-starvation is excruciating, but as one of our clients expressed, this is the only way the men at Guantanamo have left to tell the world what it means to be unjustly detained without charge or trial for more than 11 years with no end in sight. The starvation protest, which began in February, has created headlines around the world. Of the 100 men, 23 are being force fed to keep them alive. As you read this, it's likely that some of the men are being dragged from their cells, strapped to restraint chairs, and a rubber tube inserted up their nose and into their stomachs to pump in liquid dietary supplement. One of the men described the traumatic experience to his attorney as having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat. Last week, 40 additional military medical personnel were sent to Guantanamo to assist with the force-feedings, a practice that the American Medical Association condemned as a violation of \"core ethical values of the medical profession\" and the United Nations condemned as torture and a breach of international law. Force-feedings at Guantanamo are nothing new, and much like indefinite detention, the practice has come to define the prison. In 2005, when the first mass hunger strike at the prison took place, the Bush administration also responded by having medical personnel force-feed the men. Back then the men were fighting for due process and access to attorneys; eight years later and with more than half the prison population cleared for release by the Obama administration itself, the men are asking for an end to their indefinite detention. As President Obama said last week, the prison is \"not necessary to keep America safe. It's expensive, it's inefficient, it hurts us in terms of international standing, it lessens cooperation with our allies in counterterrorism efforts.\" It is also illegal and inhumane, as the United Nations' top independent human rights experts and the international human rights body with jurisdiction over the United States, the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, reminded the president. I would like to believe that if the president could see what lawyers at my organization have witnessed during visits with our clients in the last few weeks, he would act without delay to make good on the promise he made to close Guantanamo Bay four years ago. The toll that starvation and the violence of force-feedings have taken on the men is painful to see. They have lost 30 to 40 pounds, they look skeletal, and many are losing consciousness and coughing up blood. Last we heard, one of our clients weighed 90 pounds. I'd like to believe that if President Obama knew a man like Djamel Ameziane, he would understand that closing the prison is not a matter of political expediency but life or death. Djamel has been cleared for release, the government has said there are no \"military rationales\" for detaining him further, and other countries have expressed an interest in resettling him because he fears persecution in his home country of Algeria. Yet he continues to languish in a cell years later. What does that do to a man's spirit? The president said he continues to believe \"we've got to close Guantanamo.\" But believing is not enough. Believing in the president and having their hopes for justice raised and dashed so many times since the order to close Guantanamo was first signed in 2009 is what drove the men at Guantanamo to put their lives on the line with this hunger strike. Guantanamo is back in the news in a serious way for the first time in years, and it is the men themselves who have succeeded in putting it there, using the only peaceful means they have available to them to demand their lives back. The president has more staff members force-feeding men whom his own administration cleared for release than he has working to transfer them out. It should not take the inevitable deaths that will follow from this crisis for the president to act. He must stop pretending Congress is preventing him from doing anything. Right now he has the authority that Congress provided under the National Defense Authorization Act to start transferring the men who have been cleared using a national security waiver. He also has the power to lift his self-imposed moratorium on transfers to Yemen. Collective punishment based on nationality is as illegal as indefinite detention.

    "article": "At a South Carolina high school graduation, the valedictorian's speech began as planned but suddenly became a religious sermon in spite of his school district’s recent ban of prayers at school gatherings. Roy Costner IV, the top graduate of Pickens County, South Carolina’s Liberty High School submitted one speech for approval prior to the recent ceremony, but ended up tearing it up before a shocked crowd and giving an altogether different address. But it wasn’t entirely impromptu. 'Obviously I didn't do my job well enough,' Costner said after telling the crowd his speech had been approved by faculty. 'We're going to have to use a different one. Who cares?' Then he ripped his speech in two. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Imbued: Valedictorian Roy Costner tore up his speech and chose to address the crowd with the Lord's Prayer . ‘Those that we look up to, they have . helped carve and mold us into the young adults that we are today,’ he began again. ‘I’m so glad that both of my . parents led me to the Lord at a young age. And I think most of you will . understand when I say…’ Costner paused, threw caution to the wind and began reciting a speech his audience had likely heard before. ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name…’ Costner’s approved convocation address suddenly sounded a whole lot like the Lord’s Prayer. Costner continued as the crowd’s initial spattering of applause became a roar: . ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’ Spirited: The crowd was shocked as Costner shredded his approved speech, but the shock soon turned to applause . ‘You couldn't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering,’ attendee Brian Hoover told KSBW. But Costner pressed on, righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd. ‘For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever…Amen.’ The teenager’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and, presumably, graduations. The rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction, as it was widely perceived as a ‘ban on prayer in schools.’ Misconception? Costner went rogue, apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring 'sectarian' from school gatherings, a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the South Carolina county's schools . Pickens County School District superintendent Kelly Pew clarified the rule in a March blog post: . ‘What I find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the Board or the District want to “ban” prayer from our schools,’ she writes. ‘The difference between the Board taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation, and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign, is vast.’ Despite going rogue in the face of the county’s decision, Costner won’t be facing any disciplinary action. According to a school publication, WYFF reports, Costner will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree at nearby Clemson University in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘computer programmer overseas.’",

Costner continued as the crowd’s initial spattering of applause became a roar: . ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’ Spirited: The crowd was shocked as Costner shredded his approved speech, but the shock soon turned to applause . ‘You couldn't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering,’ attendee Brian Hoover told KSBW. But Costner pressed on, righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd. ‘For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever…Amen.’ The teenager’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and, presumably, graduations. The rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction, as it was widely perceived as a ‘ban on prayer in schools.’ Misconception? Costner went rogue, apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring 'sectarian' from school gatherings, a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the South Carolina county's schools . Pickens County School District superintendent Kelly Pew clarified the rule in a March blog post: . ‘What I find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the Board or the District want to “ban” prayer from our schools,’ she writes. ‘The difference between the Board taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation, and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign, is vast.’ Despite going rogue in the face of the county’s decision, Costner won’t be facing any disciplinary action. According to a school publication, WYFF reports, Costner will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree at nearby Clemson University in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘computer programmer overseas.’\"",

    "article": "Indiana, U.S. (CNN) -- North Korea will soon test its third nuclear device. Earlier tests in 2006 and 2009 drew worldwide condemnation, Security Council sanctions and led Pyongyang to withdraw from the six-party talks. In resolution 2087, passed on January 22, the Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea for its December 12 space missile launch and made clear that new violations would be dealt with harshly. In response, North Korea rejected Council legitimacy, asserted their right to nuclear weapons and deterrence and proclaimed it would soon conduct a new nuclear test. In addition the North engaged in some strong saber-rattling aimed at South Korea. Because some analysts believe this will be a uranium explosion, it is a game-changer for the region and poses new and unfavorable challenges to the Security Council. A successful uranium test indicates that Pyongyang has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems. It means that North Korea, if left unchecked, can both produce and export such material, raising new concerns that Pyongyang and Iran cooperate in such developments. Politically the test will reveal that the new regime of Kim Jong-Un exceeds the defiance to U.N. dictates of his predecessors in pursuing his nation's nuclear goals. Neither the prospect of stronger sanctions, nor the growing discontent of Russia and China with his behavior, appears to deter North Korea's young leader. OPINION: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke . These dilemmas confront the permanent five members of the Council with a harsh reality check regarding their unity of action and what message to convey to the north via what particular sanctions. If the Council follows the logic of resolution 2087, it will impose more extensive and punishing sanctions than ever before. Such sanctions will blacklist companies, government agencies and individuals long known for their role in illicit technology procurement and sanctions evasion. They will expand financial sanctions into areas of banking that would require substantial transnational enforcement to bite, and they may call upon countries in the region to inspect almost all North Korean trade. The economic squeeze and further isolation of the DPRK will increase substantially. These sanctions would require China to play an enforcement role against North Korean economic actors it has hitherto resisted. Seizing prohibited goods that pass through Dalian harbor and other trans-shipment points, as well as shutting down various border activities, would also fall to China. These extensive sanctions as punishment operate from the assumption that at some point the north will forego its nuclear program in order to survive as an authoritarian state. But there may be an alternative to the punishment approach that could bring Beijing on board with effective Council action. China might well accept specialized trade sanctions aimed to degrade the DPRK's ability to sustain the nuclear program for lack of material and due to prohibitive costs of sanctions busting, as a way of conveying to Pyongyang that it must return to the negotiating table. The logic of extensive new product-focused sanctions is that DPRK can make -- or jerry-rig -- only a small fraction of the advanced technologies and specialty materials that sustain an ongoing uranium enrichment program. To choke off these materials -- and the illicit means of financing them -- provides the Council with a possibility to make it technically impossible for DPRK to have a functioning uranium-based bomb program. Precise lists of dozens of the materials used in centrifuge operation that should be sanctioned are already recorded for the Council in the reports of their Panel of Experts for the DPRK. Lists of related materials have also been developed by the Nuclear Supplies Group. To date the permanent five have sanctioned only a very few of the materials on either list. The Council also needs member states to strengthen export, customs and financial controls on dual-use items that are \"below grade\" of those newly sanctioned items. This will stifle the North's ability to upgrade or jerry-rig these hitherto unsanctioned items as a way of maintaining their program. Also critical to the success of this choking of supplies would be stricter controls of the illicit financing that supports such trade. Putting strong enforcement behind the 2087 resolution's concern about DPRK cash flows, especially through its embassies, is also in order. Another, somewhat unprecedented, sanctions option would be a Council-issued travel ban on North Korea placed on all scientists, engineers and others with specialized expertise in centrifuge technologies and uranium enrichment. Political agreement on these measures will not be easy to attain among the permanent five nations of the Security Council. But a product-focused sanctions approach -- especially leveraged to aim for more direct diplomatic engagement with the DPRK while denying them material to grow their illicit programs -- has the best chance of gaining Council consensus.

    "article": "By . Tom Gardner . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 21 May 2012 . Nose hacked off, mutilated ears hidden by her dark hair, it was the magazine cover that horrified the world. But for Aesha Mohammadzai, the Afghan girl tortured by her husband for attempting to escape their abusive forced marriage, that extraordinary and harrowing Time magazine cover was just the start of the story. Four years on, she faces a new battle – a struggle to put the disturbing experiences behind her as she attempts to make a new life for herself in America. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Aesha, won political asylum in 2011, having fled to the U.S. a year earlier, aged just 18, after being promised reconstructive surgery. She arrived without speaking a word of English and illiterate in her mother tongue of Pashto. Since then she has undergone pioneering reconstructive surgery to give her a prosthetic nose and been given the education denied women back in her homeland under the Taliban. However, it appears the psychological scars from her ordeal have proven harder to heal. Those who have become close to Aesha have spoken of her displaying volatile mood swings – oscillating between violent tantrums and displaying deep affection to people around her . Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Her plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy surgery required. Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Aisha has a prosthetic nose fitted using a special adhesive. She will eventually have reconstructive surgery . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'",

Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Her plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy surgery required. Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Aisha has a prosthetic nose fitted using a special adhesive. She will eventually have reconstructive surgery . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'\"",
