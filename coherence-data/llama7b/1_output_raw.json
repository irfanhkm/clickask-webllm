A young cancer victim took the brave but life-saving decision to amputate her leg below the knee after doctors warned the disease could spread. Sophie Walton, from Upminster in Havering, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs. Specialists told the now 21-year-old, her only chance of survival was to remove her right leg below the knee. Without hesitation Miss Walton  agreed, putting her faith in her medical team, and has since been told she is free of the disease. Scroll down for video . Sophie Walton, 21, from Upminster, was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2011. By the time the disease was detected it had already spread to her lungs . Specialists told Miss Walton her only chance of survival was to amputate her right leg below the knee . She said: 'I underwent a high dose of chemo but after seven rounds I was told it wasn't effective. 'My surgeon called me in and said, \"how would you feel if I said you need your leg amputated?\" 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. 'I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice. 'My first concern was, 'how am I going to wear a bikini or dresses on holiday?' 'I was devastated but I tried not to think about it.' Miss Walton first spotted a lump on her right foot after a night out with friends. Doctors thought she had broken her foot - something an X-ray later confirmed, but when the bone failed to heal properly, she was given an MRI scan which highlighted an abnormal growth. By the time her bone cancer was diagnosed it had already spread to her lungs . Just one week after her surgeon delivered the shocking news that she may need her leg amputation, the operation went ahead. She said: 'I was pain free when I woke up but I didn't feel relieved. 'I remember looking down and being able to see and feel one leg but not the other. 'It was hard at first but as soon as I got home we moved my room downstairs and I used a wheelchair to get around. 'It took a few weeks for my stump to heal properly and for my prosthesis to be fitted.' Before having her amputation the 21-year-old had gruelling rounds of chemotherapy to try and shrink the cancer in her lungs. She said: 'It was really scary when we were told it had spread to my lungs as I knew that would be hard to treat.' She said: 'I was shocked, the lump I'd initially found was on my foot so it didn't cross my mind that I might lose my leg. I completely trusted my surgeon and I didn't have any other choice' Miss Walton made the brave decision to trial a new drug - a stronger form of chemotherapy, that could save her life but would leave her infertile. 'I had to give myself the best chance of survival,' she said. 'I had plenty of time in the future to think about how I would have children. 'I'd already lost my thick, long blonde hair with the first lot of chemotherapy.' After finishing her trial drug treatment Miss Walton's health took another turn for the worst. She had a low liver function and her gull bladder had become inflamed. Doctors diagnosed her with veno-occlusive disease (VOD) - a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed and is a known complication of high-dose chemotherapy. She said: 'It's a rare complication but it turned my eyes yellow and I was in hospital for around six weeks before being released.' But after a year of operations and treatment, in January 2013, Miss Walton was given the amazing news that the trial chemotherapy drug had worked, 90 per cent of the cancer in her lungs had disappeared. In February, she underwent an operation to remove the remaining cancer nobles from her lungs. Two weeks later she was given the all clear. 'I had check-ups every two months to begin with but now it's every three,' she said. 'I also see a reproductive doctor as the chemo has left me completely infertile. 'The year I had cancer was definitely easier than the past year. I was left with no leg, no hair and I had to drop out of university. 'I felt as though I was starting everything from scratch.' But with the support of her mother, Debra, 53, father, Steve, 59, step-dad, Richard, 52, and her two sisters, Rhyanna, 26 and Lara, 28, Miss Walton is now looking forward to the future. She said: 'I've enrolled to do veterinary care at college this month which I can't wait to start. 'I have been on holiday a few times since losing my leg too. I know I'll be back wearing shorter dresses in no time.' Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive officer said: 'Sophie's fight back to fitness after her bone cancer diagnosis and amputation is a real triumph and inspiration, not only for her friend Mark, who will run in her honour, but also for others facing bone cancer. 'All funds raised by Team Bones participants in the Great North Run on Sunday, will help us ensure this charity drives forward even more research that will make this rare and devastating cancer a curable disease. 'Primary bone cancer is a cruel and degrading disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year. Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars. 'It is the third biggest cancer killer in young adults and children, and yet survival rates haven't improved in over 25 years. 'It's only through research and awareness that we can change these devastating statistics to help people like Sophie - today and tomorrow. 'Bone Cancer Research Trust fights to improve outcomes for primary bone cancer patients through research, awareness, information and support.'\""

The capture of the Quneitra crossing by Syrian rebels, including members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. The border crossing made headlines earlier this week, when American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was handed over on the Syrian side of the checkpoint by the al-Nusra Front to U.N. peacekeepers. During the fighting on Wednesday between Syrian forces and rebels, three errant mortar rounds and some small-arms fire crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. An Israeli military officer was moderately injured, the IDF said on Twitter, and Israeli forces responded by striking two Syrian military positions. The Israeli military has closed the area around the border crossing. An activist in the Golan Heights, Shamil al-Jolani, said the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya and other rebel groups, not all of them Islamist, also were involved in the fighting. Video from the scene showed heavy smoke rising from the Syrian side of the crossing. A journalist working with CNN said that heavy shelling and gunfire erupted earlier from the Syrian side but that the situation had since calmed. Jolani said some fighters were able to reach the crossing despite bombardment by Syrian warplanes. Because of agreements with Israel, Syrian forces could not bomb the forces at the crossing, he said. Wednesday's fighting marks at least the second time rebels have attacked the crossing. In June 2013, rebels and Syrian forces battled for control of Quneitra. The violence prompted Austrian troops to pull out of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights. Israel sent tanks and troops to the border for a time, as well. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War, and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights. It is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. Obama weighing options to go after ISIS in Syria .\""

The reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch highlight changes to the law that they say have helped authorities stifle dissent. Opinion: Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' \"In the year since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in May 2012, the Russian government has unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history,\" Human Rights Watch said in its report. \"The authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws, harassed, intimidated, and in several cases imprisoned political activists, interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies, thereby threatening the viability of Russia's civil society.\" Opinion: Why Pussy Riot matters . At least two new laws have been introduced and 11 amended in the past year, according to Amnesty International, including broad provisions that allow for \"arbitrary interference\" with the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. As a result, the space for political opposition and other forms of dissent is \"rapidly shrinking,\" it said. \"These recent legal initiatives have the declared aim of ensuring public order and the protection of the rights of citizens,\" it said. \"Their effect has been the opposite: prominent government critics, opposition voices, watchdogs and ordinary individual protesters (on a wide range of issues) have all seen their rights restricted over the course of the last year.\" This is happening even though these rights are explicitly guaranteed by the nation's constitution and international human rights treaties to which Russia is party, Amnesty points out. Opinion: Russia's civil society crackdown continues . Two of the new laws \"clearly seek to limit, or even end, independent advocacy and other NGO work,\" Human Rights Watch said. One, the \"foreign agents\" law, requires any group receiving foreign funding and engaging in \"political activities\" to register as a \"foreign agent,\" the report said. Inspections conducted by authorities to enforce this law \"appeared aimed, at minimum, to intimidate civil society activists\" and could potentially be used to force some groups to either end certain types of work or close altogether, it said. Internet content has also been subjected to new legal restrictions, and another law on freedom of assembly imposes limits on public demonstrations and drastic fines on those who violate it, it added. Russia's government has not yet responded to the reports. Kremlin critic in court . Meanwhile, the trial of prominent Kremlin critic and opposition leader Aleksei Navalny resumed in a court in Kirov, a city about 500 miles northeast of Moscow. Navalny, a popular anti-corruption blogger, is accused of embezzling $510,000 worth of timber when he worked for the governor of the Kirov area. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million rubles ($32,000) if convicted. Navalny says the charges are revenge for his criticism of senior Russian officials and allegations of corruption by managers of state-run firms, the official RIA Novosti news agency reported. The case was previously closed by prosecutors in spring 2012 for lack of evidence, the Human Rights Watch report said. Navalny has been detained several times by Russian authorities over his political protest activities. In one example, in October of last year he was detained and charged after staging a one-man protest over police torture in front of the headquarters of the Federal Security Service in Moscow, Human Rights Watch said. Permission is not needed to stage a one-man protest. Navalny told a court that after he finished his protest, a group of journalists followed him to ask questions, \"at which point he was detained and charged with organizing an unauthorized rally,\" the report said. Amnesty International's report also raises concerns about past court cases brought against Navalny. Putin's election to a third term as president in May 2012 came less than six months after parliamentary elections sparked the largest protests seen in decades in Russia. The issue of free speech in Russia was thrust into the international spotlight last year with the trial of three members of the punk band Pussy Riot, a legal action widely condemned by rights groups. All three women were convicted of hooliganism for performing a song critical of Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral, in a brief but provocative protest action. Two are still in prison.\""

The Department of Transportation is proposing to explicitly ban the use of the devices on planes. \"Airline passengers have rights, and this new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion surrounding the use of electronic cigarettes in flight,\" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Electronic cigarettes look like the real thing, but they're actually battery-operated devices that turn nicotine into a vapor that is inhaled by the user, according to the FDA. They're a potential cause for concern because \"there is a lack of scientific data and knowledge of the ingredients in electronic cigarettes,\" the DOT said. But the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association criticized the move, insisting that the devices only emit water vapor. \"It makes absolutely zero sense,\" said Ray Story, the group's CEO. \"It only gives the smoker a dosage of nicotine, but it doesn't do anything else to the innocent bystander. ... I have sat next to people who wore a particular type of cologne that was far more intrusive than what this particular product is.\" The DOT believes its current ban on smoking of tobacco products is broad enough to include electronic cigarettes, but wants to eliminate any confusion. Some airline passengers have been \"vaping\" on planes, convinced that the devices are exempt from the ban. In July, a Sandy, Utah, man was arrested after an altercation that began when he started using an electronic cigarette on board a Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. The story prompted hundreds of comments from CNN.com readers, many defending electronic cigarettes and arguing they're a smoke-free way to provide relief for passengers suffering from nicotine withdrawals during a flight. \"The problem is not with the people using this device, but with the people around them who are psychologically affected by the fact that it LOOKS like a cigarette and someone is sucking on it,\" one commenter wrote. But others worried about the safety of using the devices at 35,000 feet, as well as their health effects on others. \"I sat next to someone who was e-smoking and it's impossible to contain all of the nicotine mist. I don't want to breathe that stuff and shouldn't have to sit next to someone on a plane who is spewing chemically loaded mist. Get a patch or nicotine gum if your addiction is that bad,\" a commenter wrote. The DOT's proposed rule would apply to all U.S. and foreign airlines on scheduled flights to and from the United States. Officials are also considering whether to extend the ban on smoking to charter flights. Amtrak has already banned the use of e-cigarettes on trains and in any area where smoking is prohibited, the DOT said, and the U.S. Navy doesn't allow them below decks in submarines. The government will accept public comments on the proposal until November 14.\""

But with the water now cleaner than at any time in living memory, entrepreneurs want to build a £10 million open-air swimming pool in the middle of the Thames in Central London. Purification specialists from Germany – which has the highest water cleanliness standards in Europe – have designed a system which the scheme’s backers say will ensure that bathing is safe for visitors of all ages. Scroll down for video . The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area, while a 4ft-high glass barrier will protect swimmers from waves . The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool, with a secondary filtration device underneath the poolside decking. Health concerns have been raised about the project because of sewage overflows during heavy rain and the experience of comedian David Walliams, who suffered a bout of ‘Thames tummy’ during a 140-mile charity swim in 2011. But experts from German firm Polyplan, which has built natural swimming pools all over Europe, have come up with a solution. Tim Evans, director of British firm Gartenart, which is working on the project, said the water – unheated and chlorine-free – will be ‘as clean as anything you would find in a mountain lake’. The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool . The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area, while a 4ft-high glass balustrade will protect swimmers from waves caused by river traffic. Chris Romer-Lee, of Studio Octopi – the London architects behind the scheme – said he hoped an initial £300,000 to cover consultancy costs and other fees would be raised by crowd-funding, where members of the public can contribute to community schemes. Details can be found at thamesbaths.com. If planning permission is granted, the lido could open late next year.

ALS ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE: . Everyone from David Beckham to Anna Wintour has now completed the Ice Bucket Challenge for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also referred to as motor neurone disease. It started in August as a fun way to raise awareness and funds for charities like the ALS Association and MND Association and involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads before nominating other people to get involved. The trend began in America and took off when Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part.

After the teenager posted a message online donations started to flood in and he had soon passed £1million. He was also sent messages of support by celebrities from Piers Morgan to Sir Chris Hoy and Russell Brand. Celebrities, politicians and classmates joined his family in an outpouring of grief after the youngster lost his fight for life. Thousands flocked to donate in his memory as news of his loss spread via social media, causing the page to temporarily crash. His mother Jane told of her heartbreak at the death of the 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' teen who in the end raised more than £3million for charity. NEK NOMINATE: . NekNominate was an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game after he uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same. He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game . In some instances, teens are seen downing 'dirty pints' - or concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong spirits as part of the dare. Rebbeca Dagley, 19, infamously stripped in Asda before downing a can of lager in February. The video posted on the internet sees her walking into the supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat and walking around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle.

Meanwhile Steph-Lou Jones chose a Baywatch swimming costume, McDonald's and a pint of beer for her challenge. But Throfinn Stout, who downed a pint while flying a small aircraft, and Squaddie James Steel, who drank a goldfish, attracted criticism for their attempts at the controversial drinking challenge.

A grandmother-of-two who was jailed over unpaid council tax was freed just in time to spend Christmas at home with her family after an online appeal raised enough money to pay off her debts. Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax. But, just 48 hours before Christmas, the 52-year-old was released from HMP Bronzefield near Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill. A viral online campaign was launched to free the grandmother, on the grounds that she was on a low income and devoted her time to caring for others in her community. Mrs Buckle, of Newbury, Berkshire, was said to be a carer on a zero-hours contract, earning just £7 an hour for around 25 hours a week. It was claimed that this left her without the means to pay the bill from West Berkshire Council. The man who led the campaign to free the grandmother said she had been 'overwhelmed' with the support she had received. He said: 'She was over the moon, absolutely overwhelmed with all the support and the work that has been going on behind the scenes to get her released. She was quite unaware of it. 'She's back home now. She's having a lovely Christmas with her family.' When she was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court on November 18, it was only the second time the district council had been granted a custodial sentence for the non-payment of council tax. Mrs Buckle owed £3,500 in council tax at the time, which was reduced by £60 for each day she was in prison. Speaking at the time of the conviction, the council's executive member for finance, Alan Law, said: 'We are all obliged to pay council tax to cover the cost of numerous essential services and it is totally unfair for some people to think that this shared responsibility does not apply to them. 'I hope that this sentence gives a clear message that expecting others to pay will not be tolerated.' Campaigners insisted Mrs Buckle was a civilian, not a criminal, who had been held in unlawful custody. An online petition calling for her release garnered 1,671 signatures. Home for Christmas: Just 48 hours before Christmas, 52-year-old Mrs Buckle was released from HMP Bronronzefield Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill .

Above, West Berkshire Council offices . The High Court review granted the mother-of-three immediate bail and a judicial review application will be heard in January. A West Berkshire Council spokesman said they had simply brought the case forward to try to retrieve the money and the court decided the sentence. The council and the prison where Mrs Buckle was held said they could not comment any further on individual cases. Speaking ahead of Mrs Buckle's release, her spokesman said: 'We have been invited to turn up with cash at the prison and pay Carla's council tax bill to them directly - and she will be released immediately. 'How utterly ridiculous in 2014 - we still have the Poor Laws in operation and debtors' private prisons. 'It's completely against Carla's human and constitutional rights to be jailed for a debt she cannot afford and has no contract for.' Writing on Facebook, Mrs Buckle thanked her supporters and said she was grieving for her uncle who had passed away while she was behind bars. She said: 'To everyone that wrote to me and have sent me messages, I am not ignoring you and will get back to everyone in the near future and hope you understand that I am busy helping the heroes that put time and effort at the expense of pushing their own social lives aside for me and their sleep, to put a case together and get me out of hell. 'I'm also recovering from my traumatic experience and grieving for my uncle and saddened I couldn't be with my mother at such as sad time when she needed me the most.'\""

Analysis: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode . A curfew will be imposed in the province from 10 p.m. local time to 4 a.m., Iraqiya state TV reported. Sheikh Ali Hatem al-Suleiman, emir of the Dulaim tribes, told CNN the security forces were seeking to arrest him when they carried out the raid on his farm near Ramadi. He has been instrumental in setting up the so-called \"Army of Pride and Dignity,\" an armed force formed by the tribes in Ramadi and elsewhere in Anbar province. Each tribe is responsible for its own men and their actions. Read more: Iraq pulls plug on 'misleading' TV networks . Speaking by phone from Ramadi, which lies about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Baghdad, al-Suleiman said that dozens of Iraqi soldiers had raided one of his farms early Thursday and detained three of his farmers. Later, he said, dozens of Army of Pride and Dignity members tracked down the Iraqi army convoy that conducted the raid and clashed with it. Al-Suleiman said that the tribal fighters had managed to free the three farmers. \"This is it; enough is enough. We will attack every Iraqi army checkpoint in Anbar if they don't withdraw from Anbar province immediately,\" he said. \"We will not accept any talks or negotiations with the government anymore.\" Two other tribal leaders in Ramadi told CNN that Iraqi soldiers called the local police officers \"traitors\" because they were not cooperating with them.

We are certain that al-Maliki is a liar, the political process is just a game,\" al-Suleiman told CNN's Arwa Damon in an interview on May 5. \"Our weapons are everywhere, light, medium, and on up.\" The tribes allied themselves with al Qaeda in Iraq and battled against U.S. forces for years before turning against the terrorist group in 2006.

Tensions have grown in recent months between Iraq's Sunnis and Shiites, especially after an incident in Hawija, in Kirkuk province, last month where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. At least 50 people were killed and more than 85 others injured in a clash between security forces and gunmen. Sunnis, who comprise a minority of Iraqis, had clout during the Saddam Hussein era but have been politically marginalized since his overthrow. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. Since December, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of predominately Sunni provinces -- including Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala -- demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community.

Liu knocked over the first hurdle, injuring his right ankle and inflaming an Achilles tendon injury that ruined his medal ambitions at the 2008 Games. Liu then hopped on his left foot down the remainder of the track in a symbolic completion of the race, pausing to kiss the final hurdle. \"What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit,\" said Feng Shuyong, the leader of the Chinese athletics team, in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. \"Winning is not so important, participation is what matters.\" \"We've all seen how hard it is for him. It is such a pity but his spirit is there,\" Feng continued. \"I think he made a lot of efforts over the past four years trying to do well. But in competitive sports, anything can happen.\" \"Liu's spirit and sportsmanship won praise, not only from Chinese sport officials and millions of Chinese, but also from his foreign friends and opponents,\" wrote Xinhua.

Write one sentence to comfort him.\" All eyes in China were on Liu at the London Olympics Tuesday, as he sought to redeem himself after limping off the track at his first-round heat at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. The outpouring of sympathy toward Liu is a marked contrast to the sharp anger and widespread criticism lobbed at him at the Beijing Games. His abrupt withdrawal in what was China's most anticipated event brought his coach, fans, and reporters literally to tears in the stadium. Back then, Chinese fans denounced him as a \"coward\" who should have finished the match before quitting. Some complained that they had paid 20 times the retail price for tickets to see Liu compete in Beijing, and demanded a refund. China's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu's symbolic completion of the race, as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf. At 29, Liu is also not expected to compete in another Olympics. The Shanghai native shot to international stardom when he won a gold medal in the 110-metre hurdles at the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. His victory secured China its first men's track and field gold medal. After a 13-month recovery period, Liu returned to the track at the 2009 Shanghai Grand Prix, finishing in second place. He went on to place first in several 110-metre hurdles competitions, including the 2010 Asian Games, 2011 Asian Championships, and 2012 Diamond Leagues held in Oregon and Shanghai. His coach, Sun Haiping, told Xinhua on August 3 that Liu's Achilles tendon injury had flared up at his training camp in Germany ahead of the London Olympics, although he said they were confident it was under control. Liu also pulled out of the London Diamond League in London in July, citing back problems. Chinese media reported that Liu will undergo surgery for his Achilles tendon at a London hospital Wednesday. At 12.91 seconds, Liu's performance in Athens is the fastest 110-metre Olympic record to date. His performance of 12.88 seconds in 2006 IAAF Super Grand Prix is his personal best and the world's second-fastest record after Cuba's Dayron Robles. CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.\""

The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court. She is the third Czech woman, after Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotna, to claim the Wimbledon singles crown. Both were in the Royal Box to witness her triumph and Kvitova paid them both a compliment as she savored her victory. \"It's hard to find some words, to see the great players in the Royal Box,\" said Kvitova, the first left-hander since Navratilova in 1990 to win the title. \"It's very nice when they're watching me all the time and supporting me, it's great.\" Russia's Sharapova was bidding to repeat her success as 17-year-old in 2004, but despite breaking Kvitova in her very first service game was largely second-best against an opponent hitting with pace and accuracy. Eighth seed Kvitova, beaten in the semifinals by eventual winner Serena Williams last year, responded with two breaks of Sharapova's service to take the first set in 40 minutes. She immediately broke Sharapova at the start of the second set and appeared to be in control, but the fifth seed retrieved it to level at two games all. Sharapova looked to gain momentum but she surrendered her service again only to show great resilience to break back again. But it was her last glimpse of glory as Kvitova broke again for 4-3 to close on her maiden grand slam title. Serving for the championship at 5-4, Kvitova carved out three match points and clinched it with an ace, sinking to the turf in triumph. But in contrast, it was a bitter disappointment for Sharapova, who has battled back to the top of the game after serious shoulder surgery. \"It's great to be back at this stage and holding the runner-up plate -- but I wanted the big one today,\" said Sharapova. \"But it's something I want to be back for and holding again one day.\" Defending champion Rafael Nadal and new world No.1 Novak Djokovic contest the men's singles final Sunday.\""

Judge Gladys Kessler ruled Friday the tapes can be released with modifications -- such as blurring faces -- to address the government's concerns over identifying guards, uniforms, and written materials on walls. \"Given what is already available to the public and known to the detainees, it simply is not plausible to argue that release of the videos will give rise to an additional probability of harm by encouraging the development of FCE [forced cell extractions] countermeasures,\" Kessler said in the ruling. Lawyers for a Syrian man held at Guantanamo since 2002, whose approved release is still pending, were lobbying for the release of the videos ahead of a hearing scheduled for Monday. Abu Wa'el Dhiab, 43, has been on numerous hunger strikes while in detention. He and his lawyers are seeking a preliminary injunction preventing detention facility officials from forced cell extractions [FCE], and placing him in a so-called restraint chair used for forced feedings. U.S. Navy nurse won't force-feed Guantanamo detainees . The method is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach. Several media organizations -- including the Associated Press, NPR, The New York Times and Dow Jones -- had also filed a separate brief urging the release of the tapes, which show forced feedings of Dhiab and others. The Justice Department had expressed concern about national security or other sensitive information being inadvertently revealed in open court and requested a closed hearing, but Kessler strongly dismissed the arguments and denied the request. \"This Court has full faith in the ability of counsel and the court, acting together, to handle in an efficient and appropriate manner, all the classified and protected information,\" Kessler wrote in a Thursday ruling. \"Moreover, a reasonable amount of delay and logistical burdens are a small price to pay for the virtues of judicial transparency.\" The government will likely appeal, meaning it's unlikely the videotapes will be released anytime soon. The case is Dhiab v. Bush (1:05-cv-1457).\""

Sixty years after Humphrey Bogart steered her through crocodile infested waters, the African Queen is back plying the Nile. Lovingly restored, the boat is operated by Cam McLeay, a New Zealand adventurer and Nile enthusiast, and took passengers for a ride in December. 'The African Queen belongs on the Nile. So it is so important to have the boat back home over 60 years after the film was made,' McLeay said. Classic: Lovingly restored the boat is operated by Cam McLeay (pictured) a New Zealand adventurer and Nile enthusiast who passengers for their first ride in December . In 1950 Bogart and Katherine Hepburn flew into Uganda together with a huge team from Hollywood to shoot the movie of the same name. The film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer, the captain of the African Queen - two totally different characters - who in true silver screen fashion end up falling in love despite the odds. Hepburn wrote a frothy account of the making of the African Queen, which was shot between Uganda and neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, subtitled 'How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Houston and almost lost my mind'. Based on a 1934 novel by C.S. Forester, the movie was set during First World War in German-occupied east Africa. Fan: Cam McLeay (left), owner of the African Queen, stands on his boat with his colleagues on the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . 'There were actually two of these boats, one of them was in Congo and this is the Nile's African Queen,' explained McLeay, who recounts his love affair with the Nile. 'I'm very attached to the Nile. I've travelled the full length of the river, from the Mediterranean to the source in Nyungwe,' the father of three recounted. 'I've been up and down the river for 16 years.' Back in the 1990s he set up a rafting company in Uganda's Jinja area, and then had an eco-lodge built on an island in the river. McLeay says he wants his projects to be sustainable - from both an economic and an environmental point of view. He then started thinking about a river boat to do trips and sundowner cruises for tourists, showcasing the scenery and the very varied birdlife. Picturesque: Gavin Fahey, skipper and the mechanic who repaired the African Queen, stands on the boat on the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . Timeless: The African Queen boat sails on the Nile in Jinja, Uganda sixty years after Humphrey Bogart steered her through crocodile infested waters . 'Just on this section here, we have over 100 species of birds. It's just beautiful to be on the river here at the sunset on the Equator.' McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu, where traditional Arabic-style sailing dhows with lateen sails are common. 'I was looking for an authentic African boat to run on the Nile and I was thinking of buying a Swahili dhow,' he recounted. 'Then this hotel owner said: 'Why don't you buy the African Queen? She's from Uganda!' A week later McLeay had gone to Nairobi and tracked down Yank Evans, a septuagenarian who explained how he had found the hull of the boat abandoned in northern Uganda's Murchison Falls national park 20 years earlier and had done it up. When he left Uganda for Kenya he brought the boat with him. Authentic: McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu . Another five years went by between the boat's return to the banks of the Nile and the start of services on the river. One of the challenges was to rebuild the steam engine, which was more than 100 years old. In the movie, directed by John Huston and released in 1951, the boat was powered by a diesel engine that was made to look like a steam engine. But when Evans restored it he decided to fit a real steam engine and had one airfreighted from Britain. 'When we got this boat, the boiler had been sitting around for a very long time,' explained Gavin Fahey, the African Queen's captain and mechanic, adding that he had to strip down the engine and re-machine it. Adventure: Cam McLeay (right), owner of the African Queen, stands on his boat with his colleagues on the shores of the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . McLeay explains that he has tried to recreate an atmosphere of times gone by on board his African Queen, the time when huge tracts of Africa were - for Western adventurers at least - still virgin territory waiting to be explored. 'Gavin wears the same kind of clothes as Humphrey Bogart. We have adopted the fez for the waiters, which is associated with the Sudan, where the Nile makes most of his journey', McLeay said. 'And we are serving gin and tonics, like Humphrey Bogart drank in the movie.' Keeping the engine fed with wood has virtually no environmental impact, McLeay says, since he is using wood left over from a construction project, and he has planted trees to ensure supply when that stock runs out. 'It's probably more environmental friendly then a modern boat,' he says. In 1950 Bogart and Katherine Hepburn flew into Uganda together with a huge team from Hollywood to shoot the movie of the same name .\""

A sleepy English bulldog named Roxanne is being called a hero after waking up her owners by barking while the house around them burned. A fire started early Monday morning in the Long Island home of Roxanne's owners, Michael and Susan Herlihy, quickly erupting into a blaze that required the help of firefighters from five towns, reports Newsday. Huntington Fire Chief Robert Berry says the fire started shortly before 1:30 a.m. while the family was asleep. Alert: 'Hero' bulldog Roxanne snoozes with her owner Kevin Herlihy, who she woke by barking when their Long Island home caught fire . Five-year-old Roxanne was in bed with Kevin, the Herlihys' adult son, when the house began to catch flame. Roxanne kept barking until Kevin woke up and went to alert his parents. The family called 911 and fled the house. The first fire officials arrived within minutes. 'Upon arrival, we had fire through the roof,' Berry said. Nearly 50 firefighters coming from Huntington and neighboring Long Island towns worked for 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze. Investigators currently believe it was an electrical fire. 'Shaken' by the fire, Kevin revealed the identity of the family's savior to Berry, who 'thought that was great.' Howlingly close: The Herlihy home went up in flames but the family was able to escape thanks to their bulldog Roxanne, while investigators blame an electric fire . Catnap: Facebook photos of Roxanne often show her taking a snooze but she wasn't caught napping when the Herlihy house caught fire . Pets often take action in an emergency, as a pit bull in Indianapolis proved last month when he woke his deaf owner with 'warming kisses' to save him from a fire, according to the Daily News. In photos posted on Kevin's Facebook, Roxanne is often seen dozing in bed or lounging around, but when the moment called for action, she wasn't caught napping. The family will have to do without their hero hound while the house is rebuilt, as neighbor Michael Marcinik told Newsday that the hotel where the Herlihys are staying does not allow pets.\""

The Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged. The crash came just three weeks after Quiles' wife Jenny was struck by a tow truck as she crossed a road in St Petersburg to go to a doctor's appointment. Tragic: Quiles' wife Jenny, pictured together left, was herself hit by a truck last month but miraculously their unborn child survived. But Jenny is still battling a traumatic brain injury in hospital, right . Scene: Quiles returned to the ditch where he found Stone and recounted how he prayed with her .

The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to a U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. The mood of Turkey's leaders changed in recent days, with ISIS on the nation's doorstep and tens of thousands fleeing across its border. The Prime Minister asked Parliament to consider military action this week, submitting a motion declaring that Turkey was seriously threatened by the chaos in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS has captured land and is trying to establish an Islamic caliphate. For months, ISIS has been advancing, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. The fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days, with ISIS advancing and nearly surrounding the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab, just a few miles from the border with Turkey. If ISIS takes Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. Residents told to evacuate . Residents in Kobani were ordered to evacuate Thursday by the local defense force, the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), as ISIS advanced on three fronts, seizing a number of villages just outside the city, Mustafa Abdi, a media activist in the city, told CNN. Abdi said he was waiting at the border at Mursitpinar with approximately 3,000 people waiting to cross into Turkey. Saroat Saeed, a university student, said he had made it across the border after waiting with what he said were the last civilians to leave Kobani. Only fighters trying to defend the city now remain, he said, but it is surrounded by ISIS and they face a dire situation. Alan Minbic, a YPG fighter, said Kobani had now been declared a military zone by the Kurdish force's leaders. ISIS has Kobani surrounded from three sides and its fighters are positioned very close to the city, he said. Kurdish snipers have taken up positions on high ground around the city but can expect ISIS shelling to try to dislodge them, he said. The YPG is now expecting ISIS to try to enter the city itself, Minbic said, adding that guerrilla warfare is the best chance for the defenders of Kobani because they hold the city and know it well. 'We are not afraid to die' Another YPG fighter who gave only his first name, Botan, said from Kobani that the Kurdish forces were determined to fight on. \"ISIS has surrounded us but we will fight, we are keeping our morale high,\" he said. \"We know, we have also seen, what ISIS is capable of, what brutality they can do. ... We know what they can do but we are not afraid to die, we are not afraid to fight. We know what will happen if ISIS takes over our town and what they will do to us.\" The fighters will resist neighborhood by neighborhood, he said. \"Our fight is not just for the Kurds, it is a fight for all of humanity. When people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals, it is a duty to fight.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that clashes had been reported between YPG and ISIS fighters only a few hundred yards from the east and southeast of the city. ISIS militants have seized more than 350 villages in the past 16 days and displaced no fewer than 300,000 people from Kobani and the surrounding countryside, it said. Many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the United States and its coalition partners paid to helping the Kurdish fighters in Kobani hold off ISIS. On Twitter, people are using hashtags #ObamaHearKobani and #SaveKobani as part of an effort to raise the question. There was at least one airstrike near Kobani on Thursday by the coalition, according to the U.S. military. The strike targeted an ISIS checkpoint near the town, the military said. Turkey's decision on military action came a day after newly appointed NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg stressed at his first news conference that the defense alliance was committed to protecting Turkey if it comes under attack. Special forces deployed . A possible threat to an ancient tomb -- located in Syria but considered a Turkish enclave -- also appeared to be a factor in Turkey's decision to approve going after ISIS. Reports had emerged that ISIS surrounded  the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed reports that ISIS had surrounded the site. But the debate in Parliament mentioned  increasing security risks to the white marble mausoleum. As part of the Treaty of Ankara in 1921, which ended the Franco-Turkish War, Turkey was allowed to keep the tomb despite its location in Syria, to place guards at it and to raise a Turkish flag over it. Opinion: Will Turkish boots on ground really defeat ISIS? There have been conflicting reports in recent days about what has happened at the tomb and its guards, with some claims emerging that ISIS fighters briefly took the guards captive. It has also been widely reported that ISIS has had the tomb surrounded for months. So valued is the tomb said to contain the remains of Suleyman Shah -- grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire -- that Turkey deployed special forces soldiers in March when ISIS began to take villages and towns surrounding the tomb. Allen: 'Important moment' for anti-ISIS coalition . U.N. report details abuses . While Turkey approved the use of military action against ISIS, a new United Nations report outlined \"a staggering array\" of human rights abuses committed by ISIS in Iraq over a nine-week period, including executions, killings, rape and the desecration of religious sites. The report documents \"acts of violence of an increasingly sectarian nature\" by ISIS and associated armed groups and says their abuses appear to be widespread and systematic. From women reportedly being shot in the head for refusing to treat ISIS fighters, to the execution of Sunnis who refused to swear allegiance to ISIS, to the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque, it's a litany of horrors. Produced jointly by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the report covers the period from July 6 to September 10, when ISIS was advancing across a swath of northern Iraq. The abuses \"include attacks directly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, executions and other targeted killings of civilians, abductions, rape and other forms of sexual and physical violence perpetrated against women and children, forced recruitment of children, destruction or desecration of places of religious or cultural significance, wanton destruction and looting of property, and denial of fundamental freedoms,\" the report said.

Getting away: Catherine Hoggle, who has been missing along with her two children have been missing since earlier this week, is seen here sneaking out of a restaurant after lying to husband Tory Turner about the location of their children . Missing: Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Hoggle, 27 and her two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, (left) and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle (right) Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing. The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare. Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center. 'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children. Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7. Searching: Troy Turner hands out flyers at a Germantown shopping center where his wife is known to frequent. No clues: Hoggle is a paranoid schizophrenic . On Sunday, police say Hoggle took the children to her mother's Clarksburg house. She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her. Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police say Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since. Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job. Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home. Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known. Police described Hoggle as a white female, 5-feet-6-inches tall, 160 pounds, with brown eyes and shoulder length black hair. She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black tank top. Officials said they hope that a friend is watching the children and does not know that police are hunting for them.\""

Police have released the graphic surveillance footage, which shows Joo Yoon knocked off his bicycle and thrown into the road, in an effort to track down the driver who fled the scene moments after the fatal accident.

Scroll down for video - Warning: Graphic images and video . Graphic: The horrifying moment a 90-year-old man was struck by a motorist and left to die in a busy Los Angeles intersection has been caught on video . As he's making his way across, he is fatally struck by a car driving with right of way through the intersection. In a split-second, the victim is thrown up onto the hood of the car and then into the road as his bike is flung feet in the air. The driver continues down the street where he briefly pulls over and has a conversation with a following car before both drivers speed away. Other motorists finally stop and presumably call 911 as Yoon remains lifeless in the middle of the street. Hit: Joo Yoon, 90, is seen in the graphic video as the Nissan with racer stripes strikes him . Suspect: The suspect's car, pictured, flings the man's bike feet in the air and Yoon ends up in the road . Police said the victim was taken to the hospital, where he later died. It is a crime for a driver involved in a crash not to remain at the crash site to render aid or to identify themselves. Los Angeles police, having come up with no leads in the investigation so far, have released the graphic footage in the hope the public will help them identify the driver. The suspect's car was described as a dark grey or gun-metal Nissan GT-R, with a 3-inch white racing stripe on both sides stretching from the front fender to the tail light. Hit-and-run: A witness goes to help the man in the road as the suspect, whose car is pictured in the background, converses with another car before both drive off . Sad: Other cars continue to drive around the body through the intersection before help finally arrives . Police said the vehicle will likely have damage to the front bumper area and the hood, where it struck the elderly man. The driver was described as an Asian man in his mid-20s with black hair and brown eyes. He was about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed about 190 pounds, they said. Authorities are also hoping to speak to the driver of the second car, described as possibly a newer model Audi, which was black or dark in color.\""

Fresh on the heels of the infamous Red Wedding, Sunday's \"Game of Thrones\" served up more murderous matrimony. But, with what fans have dubbed the \"Purple Wedding,\" many of us finally got something we'd been hoping for since season one. As the loathsome King Joffrey lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of Violet Beauregarde from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives: Who did it? Certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic, smug boy king. Here, we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed. Let us know your theory in the comments (and, book readers, no spoilers, please!) Tyrion . He's obviously Cersei's top suspect. And it's not like he doesn't have reasons. There was no love lost between Tyrion and his nephew (remember the much-celebrated slap?) even before Joffrey went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly, both before and after the wedding. Slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book? Check. Wine on the head? Check. Trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast? Check. Was it all just too much for Tyrion? Not hard to imagine. Sansa . And then there's Tyrion's wife. Joffrey was responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and brother. And that's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage. (Not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point.) Sansa may be as close to an innocent as still exists in King's Landing. But what better time than Joffrey's wedding day to exact some revenge? Oberyn Martell . \"The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\" When the Martells sent fiery warrior Oberyn to the wedding in place of his brother, Prince Doran, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they haven't forgotten, or forgiven, that Oberyn's sister, Elia, was raped and killed by Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane, who serves the Lannisters. It only took hearing a Lannister song, \"The Rains of Castamere,\" to send Oberyn into an anti-Lannister stabbing fit at a brothel. Was murdering Joffrey his plan all along? The Tyrells . The wedding was over. Margaery was a queen. But Margaery and the rest of the Tyrell family, particularly Margaery's grandmother Olenna, had no doubts about what a rotten little bastard (literally) Joffrey was. It's possible they've concocted a scheme to off Joffrey, but still press their claim for the Iron Throne now that Margaery has a crown on her head. Stannis and Melisandre . As Jaime told Joffrey, the war is not over. We assume Joffrey's transition to a lovely shade of purple was due to poisoning. But could it have been more dark magic from the Red Priestess instead? It's easy to focus on the people who were at the wedding. But we've already seen what Melisandre can do to a foe without having to be in his presence. Could this have been an otherworldly announcement that Stannis is down, but not out? Somebody else? Seriously, who doesn't have one reason or another to want Joffrey dead? Lord Varys isn't called \"The Spider\" for nothing. He's sneaky, as well as professing to be the only person in Westeros who truly wants what's best for the kingdom. He could have decided that's not Joffrey. Knight-turned-fool Ser Dontos was obviously up to something. Was this part of a plan to save Sansa and avenge his humbling by Joffrey? It's hard to imagine how Daenerys could have played a part from across the Narrow Sea. But could someone loyal to the Targaryens have made a move to weaken the Lannisters' hold on the throne? We can presume it will all become clear in time. Meanwhile, we'll make a mental note to never, ever, accept a wedding invitation in Westeros.\""

Red Bull driver Vettel took the checkered flag at Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix to win his seventh race of the year and extend his lead over Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in the drivers' standings to 60 points. Despite an encouraging race which saw Alonso finish in second place after starting seventh on the grid, team principal Stefano Domenicali declared that Ferrari will be prioritizing 2014 between now and the end of the current season. \"Now it's clear that 99% of our energies will be concentrated on the 2014 project,\" Domenicali told Ferrari's official website. \"Ahead of the summer break we were striving hard for a performance gain in Singapore, on a track with characteristics that are particularly unsuitable for our car. \"Instead we lost even more ground, despite the fact that the F138 has improved in certain ways, otherwise Fernando would never have managed to do what he did in the second part of the race in terms of tire management. Blog: Does F1 lack compelling characters? \"We still have some new parts for the car that we will bring to the coming races but, above all, we will now try to make the most out of what we already have.\" Two-time world champion Alonso last week pledged his loyalty to Ferrari amid reported interest from former team McLaren, and on Saturday said he wants to extend his contract. Next season Alonso will be partnered by Kimi Raikkonen, the current Lotus driver who was the last man to win the drivers' championship for Ferrari in 2007. Alonso hopes a raft of new technical regulations which will be introduced to the sport next season will benefit Ferrari. \"We started (the season) in a good way,\" the 32-year-old, who is without a grand prix win since May, told the BBC. \"We were competitive in Australia, maybe not in qualifying but in the race we were taking care of the tires very, very well, together with Lotus. \"We won in China, we won in Spain and then we seemed to lose a little bit of performance, especially when the 2012 tires came back. \"For next year, we start from zero. Really we will put all our effort and hopes into 2014, because starting from zero is our best opportunity to close the gap with all the top teams.\"\""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel to reconsider long-term plans to build more than 20,000 units, according to a press release from Netanyahu's office. \"This step does not contribute to settlement,\" the statement said. \"On the contrary, there is damage here for settlement.\" \"This is a meaningless step -- legally and in practice -- and an action that creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with Iran. At this time, the attention of the international community must not be diverted from the main effort -- preventing Iran from receiving an agreement that will allow it to continue its military nuclear program. As a member of the government, action must be coordinated and have the benefit of forethought.\" Ariel said he would accede to Netanyahu's request, according to the press release. Lior Amihai of the activist group Peace Now said the Housing Ministry issued 23,786 planning tenders two weeks ago; the tenders are issued to companies to draw plans to be used in possible future construction. The construction was to have taken place in a number of years, after the plans went through various stages of government approval, he said. Lara Friedman, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now in Washington, said the plans had included construction in areas deep in the West Bank, east of the barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank. \"This is planning for areas that cannot possibly remain part of Israel or become part of Israel under any negotiated agreement,\" Friedman said before Netanyahu's announcement. \"It's impossible.\" A member of the PLO executive committee also said earlier that Netanyahu appeared to be intent on scuttling any hope for a solution in peace talks recently relaunched by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. \"Obviously, Netanyahu is using settlements as a weapon of mass destruction to destroy the chances of peace and torpedo the negotiations,\" Hanan Ashrawi said. \"It is an affront to the whole world and particularly to John Kerry and a deliberate violation to international law.\" There are currently more than 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, according to the Israeli Bureau of Statistics, and about 200,000 in East Jerusalem.

The case, branded ridiculous by MPs, will be funded entirely by the public even though the farmer has never set foot in this country. The 33-year-old Ethiopian – granted anonymity to protect his family – says ministers are funding a one-party state in his country that has breached his human rights. He says foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘brutal treatment’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land, against the International Development Act 2002. Taxpayers will pay for both the farmer’s lawyers and a defence team from the Department for International Development, in a case that could cost tens of thousands of pounds. This is in addition to the £1.3billion Britain has sent to Ethiopia since 2010. The farmer lodged the court papers from Kenya, before Justice Secretary Chris Grayling introduced rules to prevent cases being brought by those who have never set foot in the UK. The changes, which come into force next month, will mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in Britain for at least 12 months. A Whitehall source said: ‘Whatever hardships this man has faced, the idea that someone without any connection to this country can get public money to sue the Government borders on the farcical.’ Tory MP Peter Bone, a fierce critic of UK aid policy, said the legal action was ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘This is a ridiculous case and it is ridiculous there is legal aid for it.’ However, he added: ‘If money is going to a corrupt regime and somebody is pointing that out then we should be taking note of it. That is the problem. A lot of the money goes on propping up corrupt regimes.’ It is not clear how the farmer, a father of six identified only as O, came to bring the case. Papers lodged earlier this year state he had to leave his family and flee to a refugee camp in Kenya after being beaten and tortured trying to protect his land. The UK has contributed to a £510million Protection of Basic Services fund which has allegedly ‘contributed’ to the programme of displacing the farmers. O is not personally seeking compensation, but wants the Government to change its aid policies and stop bankrolling brutal regimes. If he succeeds, ministers could be forced to review donations to other nations accused of atrocities, such as Pakistan and Rwanda. Leigh Day has earned vast sums in legal aid by bringing cases against the Government on behalf of overseas clients. Last year the firm won compensation worth almost £20million for 5,200 Kenyans who were tortured and abused during the Mau Mau rebellion in the Fifties and Sixties. It is also heavily involved in the Al Sweady Inquiry, examining claims that troops executed and tortured Iraqis at a camp near Basra in 2004. The hearings have already cost taxpayers £27million, despite evidence linking the men to a ‘terrorist organisation’. Ethiopia is Africa’s oldest independent country. Apart from a five-year occupation by Mussolini’s Italy, it has never been colonised. Drought, war and famine brought millions to the brink of starvation in the Eighties. This inspired rock stars to launch Band Aid. Now led by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, its economy has grown rapidly since civil war ended in 1993. However, it is still one of Africa’s poorest states, with its population of  86.5million earning an average of just £240 a year. O is being represented by Rosa Curling of Leigh Day. Her law firm has already brought a string of human rights-based legal aid cases against the State on behalf of overseas claimants who say they have suffered ill-treatment due to government policies. Ministers had urged the High Court to reject the latest claim, but Mr Justice Warby said yesterday it was ‘reasonable’ for O to believe there was a link between the Department for International development handing aid to Ethiopia and alleged human rights abuses. He said O may launch a judicial review to argue the department had ‘failed to have in place any sufficient process to assess Ethiopia’s compliance with the express conditions for receiving UK aid – or to follow such process’. International Development Secretary Justine Greening, who is named as the respondent on the court papers, denies the claims. A department spokesman said: ‘The UK has never funded Ethiopia’s resettlement programmes. Our support to the Protection of Basic Services Programme is only used to provide essential services like healthcare, schooling and clean water.’\""

Kevin Liverpool is alleged to have wrote his thoughts about Joss Stone, pictured leaving Exeter Crown Court on Tuesday, in a diary . One of the men accused of plotting to decapitate Joss Stone kept a list of potential targets in a diary – including Beyoncé and Girls Aloud, a court heard yesterday. Kevin Liverpool, 35, is said to have written down his alleged  violent plan in a notebook. Other stars mentioned in the scrawled pages are rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Craig David, R Kelly and Chris Brown, the jury was told. The court heard there were numerous urban slang words, such as ‘wet’ – meaning to stab someone until their clothes are soaked with blood – and ‘popo’ - short for police. One entry was said to read: ‘God doesn’t give a f***. Protect yourself from this. Remember Jocelyn Stone. 'God let her take the p***.’ Other notes mentioned the need to buy a semi-automatic gun, a gun holder, a silencer and infra-red equipment, as well as a ‘ninja sword’, it was said. Liverpool had also written a reminder to buy a hooded top, car insurance, a safe and open a bank account, the court was told. Liverpool and co-accused Junior Bradshaw, 32, are charged with plotting to rob and kill Miss Stone before dumping her body in a river in June 2011. The defendants, both of St Stephen’s Close, Manchester, deny charges of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause GBH and conspiracy to rob. The diary was seized by police when they raided Liverpool’s one-bedroom flat in Longsight, Manchester, after he had been arrested in Devon. In the diary - a daily 2007 edition - each page was covered in handwritten scrawl, in either blue or black ink, with much of it crossed or scribbled out, the court was told. Detective Constable Katherine Joyner took the jury of 10 men and two women through the diary. In the diary other musical stars were . listed, such as British rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Beyonce, Craig . David, R Kelly, Chris Brown and Girls Aloud. The . notes included details of Miss Stone’s date and place of birth and a . biography of her musical career, including the albums she has released. On trial: A court drawing of Kevin Liverpool (left) and Junior Bradshaw in the dock at Exeter Crown Court .

Con Joyner confirmed under cross-examination from Philip King QC, . representing Liverpool, that following her detailed examination of all . the documents seized by police she never found a picture of Miss Stone . or a ransom note.

The Healthy Diet Study 2014, by Galaxy Research, has exposed the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets, which can restrict nutrients and vitamins needed for ideal psychological development. The study found that 82 per cent of parents give their children the same meals when they are on diets themselves, largely because it was more convenient than making separate meals. Scroll down for video . The Healthy Diet Study 2014 , led Galaxy Research, exposes the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets for children . The research found that a further 45 per cent of these parents limited the bread their children ate, and 17 per cent cut carbs from their children’s diet altogether. Popular diets such as paleo and clean-eating have seen a marked drop in carbohydrate intake among Australians, which can lead to a deficient intake of fibre, grains and protein. Sydney based paediatric dietician Hanan Salah told Daily Mail Australia she condemns restrictive low carbohydrate diets for children. ‘There are often overweight or obese parents who try to cut out food groups. In doing so, they put their children on these restrictive diets,’ she said. ‘Carbohydrates are essential to the brain function of children at school, as well as maintainingenergy levels. Carbohydrates also release serotonin, so restricting this can result in a drop in mood, and even the potential for depression in the long term.’ Ms Salah said that while the diets can lead to weight loss in overweight children, they will miss out on essential nutrients such as fibre and other vitamins. Dietician Hanan Salah said low carbohydrate diets can lead to a drop in serotonin and even the potential for depression in the long term . She recommends parents make smarter choices with regards to the portion and quality of food. ‘Rather than cutting out food groups, we recommend reducing portions for overweight families. Don’t worry about spending hours cooking complex meals. Opt for low GI carbohydrates such as brown rice and dark breads,' she said. ‘Ultimately carbohydrates are essential for children to thrive and be happy.’\""

The Labour leader, speaking about his religious beliefs in detail for the first time, said he would be the ‘first Jewish prime minister’ if he wins the next election. But he said his faith, which is ‘part of who I am’, is compatible with being an atheist, claiming that like many religious believers, he hopes to ‘change the world’. David Cameron, who spoke about his own faith this week, is the only one of the three party leaders to say he believes in God, as Nick Clegg is also an atheist. But during his tour of Israel and the West Bank, Mr Miliband distanced himself from the last Labour government which, in the words of spin doctor Alistair Campbell, did not ‘do God’. Britain, he said in an interview, is a ‘Christian country’ despite declining observance, and he strongly believes religion ‘nourishes people’. He said: ‘I have a particular faith. I describe myself as a Jewish atheist. I’m Jewish by birth origin and it’s a part of who I am. ‘I don’t believe in God, but I think faith is a really, really important thing to a lot of people. It provides nourishment for lots of people. ‘In terms of faith for me, it’s a faith about how you change the world. And that is actually true for a lot of religious people as well.’ Faith, he said, has an ‘important place in society’ and he added that many faith schools do an ‘incredible job.’ On tour: During his tour of Israel and the West Bank, Mr Miliband distanced himself from the last Labour government.

He even claimed Jesus was . responsible for his ‘Big Society’ policy.

But one luxury chain has taken a rather different approach – warning customers that carrying too many shopping bags could be a health risk. Harvey Nichols has teamed up with TV doctor Rosemary Leonard to tell shoppers they risk pulled muscles, neck strains – even fainting – if they don’t balance their bags correctly or overload themselves with too many bargains. Shopping, darling: Absolutely Fabulous stars Edina, played by Jennifer Saunders, and Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley are serial shoppers and fans of Harvey Nichols in the BBC sitcom .

It has even issued arm bands to help them mark the cut-off . point. Meanwhile . bargain-hunters intent on a massive shopping spree are advised to order . online so they can have the bags delivered straight to their front . door. Dr . Leonard, who is BBC Breakfast’s resident doctor and a part-time GP, . said: ‘It might sound silly but carrying numerous bags can put untold . physical pressure on a shopper’s body. ‘Restriction of blood flow is common, . which means people can experience tingling of the fingers and in more . extreme cases numbness and even fainting.

'Other symptoms an overburdened shopper . could suffer include pulled muscles plus neck and wrist strain. As a GP .

Previously, the British Osteopathic Association revealed that four in ten women have suffered discomfort in  their neck, back or shoulders from regularly carrying a heavy handbag. Apparently it hasn’t put off savvy shoppers. Research has revealed how women walk up to 154 miles a year hunting for bargains – the equivalent of trekking from London to Nottingham. The Debenhams poll of 2,000 women revealed the average woman covers 2.96 miles on a shopping trip and spends around 2.5 hours browsing in stores every week. In contrast, men spend just an average 50 minutes and cover just 1.5 miles per week. Women also burn around five calories for every minute spent shopping – almost 48,000 per year – according to a separate poll.\""

A graffiti artist painted a memorial to Leon Bartholomew who died from a rare form of cancer . A graffiti artist has paid tribute to a two-year-old boy who died from a rare form of cancer by spray painting the toddler's face onto a 30ft memorial wall. Scott Vincent spent two days painting the skate park mural in honour of little Leon Bartholomew, who lost a six month battle against the disease. It shows the cartoon-mad youngster with Mickey Mouse ears and has been described as a 'shrine' by his grieving father Daniel, 25. Family and friends have flocked to the wall in his hometown of New Milton, Hampshire, to lay flowers, light candles and add messages. Leon was diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, which caused tumours to form his lungs and brain. Mr Bartholomew was touched when Mr Vincent travelled from his home in Brighton, East Sussex, to commemorate Leon's life. He described the finished work as a 'perfect picture' of his son. The former warehouse worker, who had to quit his job when Leon fell ill, said: 'The whole family was warmed when we saw the wall for the first time. 'We were all devastated when Leon passed away after battling a rare form of cancer for six months. 'But the wall is the a great way to remember our son and people have treated it with respect - it's just like a shrine.' The wall is on the grounds of the skate park in New Milton where neighbours have been paying their respects. Mr Bartholomew added: 'The response from the public has been amazing. 'Even people that didn't know Leon or the family have been down to the wall to lay flowers and light candles. Tribute: Scott Vincent spent two days painting the skate park mural in honour of little Leon Bartholomew, who lost a six month battle against the disease . Talented: Scott Vincent spray painting the wall in honour of Leon Bartholomew . Mr Bartholomew was touched when Mr Vincent travelled from his home in Brighton to commemorate Leon's life . Missed: Leon was diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, which caused tumours to form his lungs and brain . 'Everyone loves it and the graffiti wall is the talk of the town. 'People have been writing special messages, it's great because it's as if it's Leon's wall.' The family heard of Mr Vincent from a friend who contacted him about doing something special for Leon. Mr Bartholomew added: 'We gave the artist a photo of Leon and he has managed to recreate the perfect picture of our son. Five tumours were found in Leon's brain when he was rushed to hospital after a suffering a seizure . 'It only took Scott two days to spray and I couldn't believe how accurate it was, as he just used a photo we gave him. 'He wanted to create something light-hearted and fun and decided to spray it as a cartoon. I think it's perfect. 'Leon loved cartoons. We love the wall and think it's perfect. I can't thank Scott enough. 'People still go down to the skate park every day to pay their respects.'. A Facebook page was set up so Leon's family could receive messages of support from well-wishers and update people on his progress after he was diagnosed in October 2012. In February, Leon was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure, where he was stabilised and recovered well. But a CT scan revealed five tumours in his brain and he passed away on March 22. His family informed followers of his death by writing: 'Leon Bartholomew fell asleep and grew his angel wings this morning surrounded by love and kindness. 'No matter what was thrown at him, no matter what he had to go through, he always came back fighting, with a giggle and a cheeky grin. 'Not many people could go through the things he did and not complain a single time. 'He had so much fight in him, and so much strength, he truly was an inspiration to us all. 'We love him with our entire hearts, minds and souls.'

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"The United States has increased its military presence in Iraq, ordering 300 more troops to the violence-ravaged nation, the Pentagon announced Monday. ISIS militants have \"continued to pose a legitimate threat to Baghdad and its environs,\" a U.S. official told CNN. \"We have seen them reinforce themselves around Baghdad enough to convince us more troops was the prudent thing to do.\" The new troops, 200 of whom arrived Sunday and Monday, will provide security for the U.S. Embassy, the Baghdad airport and other facilities in Iraq, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The deployment includes \"a detachment of helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles, which will bolster airfield and travel route security,\" Kirby said in a written statement. The airport is in western Baghdad about 12 miles (20 kilometers) by helicopter from the embassy in the capital's fortified Green Zone. The 300 troops are in addition to 300 U.S. advisers who will help train Iraq's security forces. They will bring the total of American forces in Iraq to about 800 troops. Revered Shiite shrine attacked . On Monday, Three mortar rounds hit the outer gate of a Shiite holy site in Samarra, killing one person and wounding 14, a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said. Al-Iraqiya, a state-run television network, reported that the Iraqi air force demolished the site where the mortars were fired. The Al-Askariya mosque was heavily damaged by militants in February 2006. That attack triggered retaliatory attacks against Sunnis, and touched off the sectarian fighting that nearly tore the country apart. The mosque houses the Imam Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari shrine, one of the holiest sites for Shiite Muslims. Samarra is about  80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The death was one of 1,873 in June due to violence, according to the Interior Ministry, a figure that includes 355 Iraqi soldiers and 130 police officers. That is a dramatic increase from the May death toll of 994 given by the United Nations and health officials in restive Anbar province. The U.N. said 144 of the people killed in May were civilian police officers. ISIS declares caliphate . Emboldened by a weakened Iraqi government that is struggling to stop their murderous advance, extremists of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria declared over the weekend that they have set up a caliphate spanning large areas of the two countries. In a newly released audio message and written statement, purportedly from the official spokesman of ISIS, the group called on Muslims to swear allegiance to the caliphate, which means Islamic state. The group said in the message Sunday, which CNN couldn't independently confirm, that its flag now flies from Aleppo province in northwestern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq. It announced that it was changing its name to just the \"Islamic State.\" The ISIS statement was just one of the many developments in the fast-moving situation in Iraq over the weekend. How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda . Who controls Tikrit? Iraq's government touted its military offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists, with some officials taking to state-run television over the weekend to declare that the army had defeated ISIS. But residents in the city nestled along the Tigris River, about 140 kilometers (about 87 miles) northwest of Baghdad, gave a different account Sunday. \"There are no Iraqi troops here,\" one woman told CNN by telephone from Tikrit. The only presence, at least in her neighborhood, is the \"Islamic state,\" she said, referring to ISIS. The woman, who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety, said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle, in the form of shelling, being carried out by both sides. Heavy shelling . A video posted on YouTube appears to support her assertion. A man gives a tour of the city to show, he says, that there were no Iraqi security forces on the streets on Saturday, the day Iraqi forces said they launched the offensive. In the video, the man can be heard repeatedly saying \"June 28, 2014,\" presumably to offer evidence of the date. He says \"Thank God, Tikrit is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of 'al-Haliki,' \" a derogatory reference to al-Maliki that refers to his death. Witnesses inside and outside Tikrit said Iraqi forces were heavily shelling the city. Two days ago, the air force dropped leaflets from helicopters, demanding that residents leave the city \"for their safety.\" A large number of people have fled Tikrit for smaller villages to the north, according to witnesses, who say Iraqi forces are battling ISIS on the southern edge of the city. State-run Iraqi TV showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city. Another video, released by the Ministry of Defense, showed Iraqi troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert. The video was titled \"cleansing the road between Samarra and Tikrit.\" CNN couldn't independently confirm the different claims. Russian jets arrive . Five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets have arrived in Iraq, the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract between Moscow and Baghdad, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said in a statement. A video the ministry released Monday showed the jets, with wings unattached, being pulled toward hangars. \"These jet fighters will contribute to increase the combat capability of the air force and the rest of the armed forces in eliminating terrorism,\" the ministry said. The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime. The announcement follows a comment by al-Maliki that recent militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. \"I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract\" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. \"God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,\" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s \"weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,\" Kirby said. \"And we were in the process of working towards that delivery.\" The advance of the al Qaeda splinter group \"couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,\" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. Mass graves reported . Human Rights Watch has reported the discovery in Tikrit of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by ISIS and its militant allies. In addition to the alleged executions in Tikrit, reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides. Human Rights Watch, citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists, said Saturday that ISIS fighters kidnapped at least 40 Shiite Turkmens, dynamited four Shiite places of worship and ransacked homes and farms in two villages just outside Mosul. The few Sunni villagers who remained in Guba and Shireekhan told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped Turkmens had been killed, the rights group said. However, they had not seen bodies and could not give more information. ISIS destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shiite Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Mosul, earlier in the week, Human Rights Watch added, citing local sources. But the allegations of atrocities are not just limited to ISIS. Amnesty International has said it has gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of \"extrajudicial executions\" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba.

Ford Presidential Library and Museum. Ford died Friday evening with family at her bedside, according to a family member. Elaine Didier, the director of the Grand Rapids, Michigan, museum, confirmed Ford's death to CNN. No other details were immediately available. The family is expected to release a statement later Friday or Saturday, Didier said. Condolences began pouring in soon after news broke about her death -- including from celebrities who sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center. \"As far as I'm concerned, Betty Ford saved my life,\" Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks said. Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, who revealed in his recent autobiography that he was treated at the Betty Ford Center for drug addiction, also praised Ford's work. \"Betty Ford took a risk at one of the worst times of her life and came forward to share a message of recovery in order to serve others,\" Tyler said. \"Her vision, passion and amazing heart led to the Betty Ford Center, the gold standard of treatment facilities. She will be missed, but her work in recovery will live on.\" President Barack Obama remembered the former first lady as a \"powerful advocate for women's health and women's rights\" and someone who \"helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction.\" His predecessor, George W. Bush, added that \"because of her leadership, many lives were saved.\" Some of the many others offering praise and sympathy included Nancy Reagan (calling Ford \"an inspiration\"), and former presidents George H. W. Bush (describing her as a \"wonderful wife and mother, a great friend and a courageous first lady) and Jimmy Carter (saying she was \"a close personal friend\" and \"a remarkable political spouse.\") Born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in Chicago, she grew up in Grand Rapids. At the age of 21, she moved to New York City to work as a dancer and model. She returned to the Midwest two years later. One year after divorcing William Warren after five years of marriage, she wed Gerald Ford -- a former star football player at the University of Michigan, decorated U.S. Navy veteran and budding Republican politician -- in 1948. That year, the woman now known as Betty Ford campaigned with her new husband on his successful venture to become a U.S. congressman from Michigan. She gave birth to three sons and a daughter over the course of their 58-year marriage. The family moved to Washington, where Gerald Ford served in the Capitol for 25 years before being tapped in 1973 as then-President Richard Nixon's vice president in place of Spiro T. Agnew. Just over 10 months later, Betty Ford became first lady when her husband was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States. Gerald Ford took office after Nixon resigned in the wake of his pending impeachment following the crisis and cover-up of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Betty Ford soon made headlines, holding press conferences and publicly discussing her diagnosis with breast cancer. The first lady talked about abortion, pre-marital sex and equal rights in an interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" in 1975 -- the same year Newsweek named her its \"Woman of the Year.\" According to the Ford library and museum's website, her candidness initially drew some criticism, but in a short time, 75% of Americans approved of her in public opinion polls. But in 1978, just over one year after leaving the White House after her husband lost his campaign to remain president, Ford made headlines of a different kind. She entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital to seek treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller abuse. That same year, she published the first of two autobiographies, entitled \"The Times of My Life.\" Ford would go on to become a high-profile example of someone who battled substance abuse issues and was a tireless advocate for drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment. \"My addiction was a combination of alcohol and the prescription drugs that ... both were a part of my life, but they did not become a problem until they overrode my common sense,\" Ford told CNN's Larry King in 2003. \"I didn't know what was happening, I just knew that I felt great and the pain was gone.\" Her work paid dividends in October 1982 when, along with Leonard Firestone, she opened the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. To this day, the center remains one of the most well-known and respected places nationwide for treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies. Ford also fought to promote awareness and research on breast cancer, with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation eventually naming an award in her honor. She earned numerous honors over her life, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 and the Congressional Gold Medal eight years later. Gerald Ford died on December 26, 2006, at the couple's home in Rancho Mirage. He was 93. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.\""

A biker who bit his girlfriend’s nose off leaving a 'gaping bloody hole' in what a judge described as a 'bestial' attack has been jailed for eight years. Simon Brittle, from Rotherham, bent down as if to kiss his girlfriend Heidi Smith’s nose but instead took a large bite, leaving her face pouring with blood. Hull Crown Court heard that Ms Smith, 44, from Nottingham, had a hole looking like 'half a ping-pong ball' where her nose used to be after the attack at a three-day motorcycle rally at South Dalton, near Beverley in East Yorkshire. She was rushed to hospital where plastic surgeons grafted skin from her hip on to her nose, but the court was told Miss Smith, a civil servant, was left with a 'pointy witch' appearance after reconstructive surgery. The attack happened at Motorcycle Action Group's Into the Valley Rally in May, and was witnessed by Sally Pearson, who told the court she could hear Miss Smith's screams above the loud music as she was pinned to the floor. She said she brushed Miss Smith’s hair away from her face and 'realised at once her nose was gone.' Ms Pearson added: 'Her nose was missing. There was a gaping bloody hole where her nose should have been.' The witness said she stayed with the distraught woman as she made a tearful call to her mother in Derbyshire to tell her a man had just bitten her nose off and she should come and pick up her motorcycle as she was on her way to hospital. The court heard that Brittle had been in a relationship with his victim for four months, and that it was a turbulent relationship that Miss Smith was too frightened to finish. Two days before the motorcycle event in the grounds of the Dalton estate, Brittle sent her a message on Facebook saying: 'I’m really looking forward to f****** you up over the weekend - take plenty of bodyguards. 'Here’s to a happy rally season. You don’t know what I am capable of.' Philip Evans, prosecuting, said that on the day of the attack Brittle became loud, drunk and aggressive, threatening to stab one man and accusing another of sleeping with Ms Smith. Heidi Smith, 44, says she has had to move from her home of 10 years because of the terrifying attack on her . He  then began punching and slapping her before twisting her arm, forcing her to the ground and straddling her. Mr Evans said: 'He pushed his thumb in her eye socket. 'That was painful, she screamed out for help, but other people thought it was a couple in an amorous embrace. 'But Sally Pearson heard a chilling scream. Others described it as blood-curdling. 'Sally Pearson took hold of Mr Brittle’s shoulder and shouted at him. The defendant was calm and Ms Pearson said he had a blank expression. 'She was told to get off. He lowered his head, as if they were going to kiss. Heidi Smith then let out an intense scream.' Ms Smith fell back on the floor holding her hands to her face in a pool of blood. Defence barrister John Thackray said: 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour. He is disgusted with himself. He was drunk. 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.  He is disgusted with himself.  He was drunk.' - Defence barrister John Thackray . 'He has gone from being a loyal partner, a good father and working man. 'There was a breakdown in the relationship. He lost his work, became a carer for his father and suffered from depression.' Sentencing Brittle, who admitted wounding with intent, Judge Mark Bury told him: 'The use of your teeth was plainly the use of a weapon. This was not just in public. This was in full view of Heidi Smith’s friends.' He jailed Brittle for eight years and imposed an indefinite restraining order on him contacting Miss Smith. Miss Smith has now had to move from the home she lived in for a decade as Brittle knew where where she lived. In a victim impact statement she said: 'I think it will be a long time before I can trust a man or be alone with them. 'I don't feel like me any more; I am embarrassed by this... I feel like people judge me' - Victim Heidi Smith, 44 . 'I don’t feel like me anymore; I am embarrassed by this. I have had to relive the incident over and over again as work colleagues asked me what happened. 'I have tried to ignore it, but it being my nose, I can’t hide it or cover it up.  I feel like people judge me and I think I have done something to deserve it. 'My family have been affected by this. My mother had to deal with me screaming down the telephone. I cannot imagine having a boyfriend again.' Four months after the May 4 attack , Miss Smith said she still had problems with her arm movement where Brittle had twisted it. She is also unable to pursue her hobbies of motorcycling and skiing because her nose is painful when she is cold. She added: 'I have to move from the home I have been in for 10 years. This incident has changed my life forever.'\""

CNN anchor Dana Bash has revealed that she too has been the target of inappropriate comments about her weight made by male senators. Speaking to fellow CNN news anchor Brooke Baldwin, Ms Bash, 43, said she wasn't surprised 'in the least' to learn of New York senator Kristen Gillibrand's recent admission that she had been called 'porky' and 'fat' by male colleagues. 'After I had my son three years ago, I got some comments that would blow you away from male senators,' the political correspondent, based in Washington D.C. said. 'Talking about getting my figure back and things like that.' Scroll down for video . Weight jibes: Dana Bash, 43 (pictured), said that after she gave birth to her son, she received comments from male senators 'about getting my figure back' Although the mother-of-one declined to outline any further specifics, she remarked that these men maybe 'didn't realize' they were being inappropriate, and largely blames their age for the comments. '[Ms Gillibrand] mentions very clearly that these are law-makers in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and it is very much generational,' she agreed. 'I can't even think of one law-maker in either party, either chamber, who would do this who is maybe 50 years old or younger.' Ms Bash - who was recently honored by ELLE magazine as part of its annual Women in Washington Power List - mentioned that she had spoken 'in private' both to Ms Gillibrand and to other female members of congress about such matters. Age matters: Ms Bash, pictured pregnant in 2011 (left) and in May (right) said, '[Ms Gillibrand] mentions very clearly that these are law-makers in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and it is very much generational' Ms Bash is currently CNN's chief congressional correspondent. She split with fellow CNN anchor John King in 2012, after less than four years of marriage and is now a single mother. Her comments come just days after Ms Gillibrand spoke openly of the sexism she has faced at various points in her political career. In her new book Off the Sidelines, the 47-year-old - who has two young sons with her husband Jonathan - recalls how a male colleague once said to her at the gym: 'Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!' On a separate occasion, a Southern congressman was walking her down the aisle in the House chamber when he said to her: 'You know, Kirsten, you're even pretty when you're fat.' New York Senator: Ms Gillibrand, 47, who has fluctuated between size four and size 20 throughout her career, has been called 'porky' and 'fat,' by male colleagues. Pictured in 2009 (left) and in April (right) Like Ms Bash, Ms Gillibrand acknowledged that the comments were derogatory, but probably not meant in earnest. 'I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot,' she said. The senator, who says she has fluctuated between size four and size 20 throughout her career, admits that regardless of other people's opinions, appearance is something that she does have to pay attention to. 'I've learned that how I look and feel is important, for reasons beyond health and vanity,' she writes. 'If I look and feel good, I'm more positive and confident and people are more likely to listen to me. If more people are listening, I have more power to fight effectively for what I believe in.'\""

Onlooker Dustin Earls captured video of the scene Saturday at the \"Monster Air 2012\" show in Harrisburg. Earls told CNN he was watching the third drag race of the event when one of the drivers started heading for a mud pit in front of the seating area. \"The truck got a little wild and he hit the mud pit,\" Earls said. \"I thought, 'This guy's just messing around; he'll hit his brakes right here.'\" But the oversized truck didn't stop. Video shot by Earls on his mobile phone shows the truck making a hard right turn and driving straight into the panicked crowd. \"I heard his axle snap as soon as he hit the mud,\" Earls said. \"As soon as he hit that line, he lost control of his steering and his brakes.\" Earls' video becomes jumbled as he runs to safety, but the screams of frightened spectators can be heard in the background. A Linn County Sheriff's sergeant told CNN affiliate KVAL three people in the crowd were hurt. Earls said the driver immediately got out of the truck to see if anyone was injured. \"He wanted to know if everything was okay,\" Earls said, \"He was so concerned. He said, 'Oh my God, I can't believe what happened.'\" KVAL reported the driver told authorities the rear wheels on his 1970 Ford spun out in the mud, and he crashed into a barricade. The truck cleared the barricade and its 48-inch tires landed on three spectators, KVAL reported. The sheriff's sergeant told KVAL the victims' injuries were not life-threatening.\""

The form of the Chile forward, signed from Barcelona in the summer for £32million, has been the one positive in an otherwise inconsistent opening by Arsene Wenger's side. Sanchez scored his 12th goal at Swansea on Sunday, when Arsenal again failed to hold onto a lead and were beaten 2-1, having thrown away a 3-0 advantage in the Champions League tie against Anderlecht. Alexis Sanchez believes he still has much to improve on despite a successful start to his Arsenal career . The Chilean (pictured celebrating after scoring against Swansea) has been a shining light for the Gunners . In a wide-ranging interview with AS Chile, the 25-year-old remains upbeat over the decision to leave Spain after the World Cup and that the Gunners can lift themselves back into contention after the international break. 'Little by little I am gaining confidence in my team-mates and am gradually learning more,' he said on www.chile.as.com. 'At first I had trouble understanding them, knowing where they ran, their movements, what gestures meant what, but every time I feel more confident. 'I am starting to memorise the moves of my team-mates and I learn to help them - clearly I need to improve and that is what I say in the dressing room, that I could stay a little less with the ball, play one touch play more often to facilitate counter-attacks, that is vital. 'I must learn that because the rapid transitions are key in this league and with this team.' While Sanchez concedes the English Premier League is 'the most complicated football and not easy' in comparison with the competitions back home and after subsequent moves to Italy with Udinese and then onto Barcelona, the diminutive forward insists he 'likes the challenge'. The Chile forward believes Arsenal have plenty of talent to come back to challenge leaders Chelsea and also progress in Europe. Sanchez is still adamant that Arsene Wenger's side can win any competition they enter . 'Now that I am here, sometimes I stop to look my team-mates during the training session and I realise that I am surrounded by a lot of quality stars,' he added. 'I have been impressed by their attitude and their talent. 'I love how they create spaces, their individual and collective movements. 'I tell you seriously: I like what I see so much that I have repeated myself many times, that if we have the required winning mentality, if we are positive and try to win every single game, I know we can win any competition. 'I know that with this team we can win many trophies in the coming years. I am convinced. 'I hope to win everything here. That's why I came.' Wenger has seen his side struggle to hold onto leads against Anderlecht and Swansea in recent weeks . Following defeat at Swansea, Arsenal find themselves in sixth place, four points behind Manchester City and already some 12 off Chelsea, who have yet to lose in their 11 league games. Like most of their rivals, the majority of the Gunners' squad are expected to be in action during the international break, with Theo Walcott back in the England fold after his recovery from a long-term knee injury, one of six Arsenal players who could feature at Wembley against Slovenia on Saturday. France striker Olivier Giroud is on course to be closing in on an earlier than expected return from a broken bone in his foot. Wenger will be hoping centre-half Laurent Koscielny can be available again following treatment on his troublesome Achilles for the visit of Manchester United on November 22, having been forced to deploy Nacho Monreal at the heart of what has looked a very suspect makeshift defence in recent games.\""

Michael van Gerwen begins his defence of the title he won last year, but the likes of Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson are all hungry to wrestle the Sid Waddell Trophy away from the Dutchman. Twenty sessions of top tungsten spread over a 17-day period over Christmas and New Year will decide who is the best darts player on the planet, and here is our guide to the big tournament. Peter Wright, Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor get ready for the 2015 World Darts Championship . Taylor (left) and Van Gerwen (right) are the two favourites for the title at Alexandra Palace . The PDC tweeted a picture showing Alexandra Palace being set up for the tournament . VIDEO 2014 World Champs: Standout moments . Phil Taylor has more world titles, but I'll buy more houses... THE MAIN CONTENDERS . Michael van Gerwen . The reigning world champion and No 1 seed for this year's tournament, Van Gerwen is among the favourites to win the title again. Having been beaten by Taylor in the 2013 final, the Dutchman bounced back in 2014 to beat Peter Wright and lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. Van Gerwen has won the World Grand Prix and European Championship this year, and begins his title defence against Joe Cullen on the opening night at Alexandra Palace. Van Gerwen won his first world title last year (right) and will be looking to retain his crown . The Dutchman will play Joe Cullen on the opening night of the 2015 tournament at Alexandra Palace . VIDEO World Championship moments - Taylor v van Gerwen 2013 . Taylor's preparations overshadowed by illness to his mother . Phil Taylor . What more needs to be said about The Power than the fact he is a 16-time world champion? Taylor has accomplished everything in the game of darts and has nothing to prove. Taylor is the pre-tournament favourite at Alexandra Palace, and he begins his quest on Friday night against German Jyhan Artut. Taylor has had some personal issues to deal with leading up to the tournament with his mum Liz suffering from a lung infection. It remains to be seen how much his mum's illness affects his performance at Ally Pally. Taylor will enter the competition on Friday night when he faces German Jyhan Artut in the first round . The stage is set up at the Alexandra Palace in north London ahead of the tournament . 2014 - Michael van Gerwen . 2013 - Phil Taylor . 2012 - Adrian Lewis . 2011 - Adrian Lewis . 2010 - Phil Taylor . 2009 - Phil Taylor . 2008 - John Part . 2007 - Raymond van Barneveld . 2006 - Phil Taylor . 2005 - Phil Taylor . Adrian Lewis . Jackpot is a two-time world champion having won the title in both 2011 and 2012. But on both occasions since then, Lewis has run into a red-hot Van Gerwen, losing 5-4 in a thrilling quarter-final in 2013 and 6-0 in the semi-final 12 months ago. Lewis enters the tournament as the No 3 seed and opens his campaign against David Pallett. It's a tricky section of the draw he finds himself in, though, with potential matches with Raymond van Barneveld and Taylor on the way to the final. Gary Anderson . The Flying Scotsman has enjoyed a resurgence this year, entering the World Championship as the No 4 seed on the back of his win at the Players Championship, his first appearance in a premier event final for three years. Anderson took Ally Pally by storm in 2011 with his stunning scoring but came up short in the final, losing 7-5 to Lewis. But Anderson's life turned upside down soon after that when he lost both his brother Stuart and father Gordon in a short space of time. Anderson admitted that times were tough, but he seems to be back to his best on the oche now. Adrian Lewis won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012, but has been beaten by Van Gerwen both times since . Gary Anderson is returning to his best form this year and is one of the favourites for the title . Peter Wright . Having never previously been past the third round at the World Darts Championship, Wright produced a remarkable run all the way to the final in 2014. The man known as 'Snakebite' was eventually beaten by Van Gerwen in the final, but he won many admirers, not least for his extravagant hair styles and dress sense. Wright stunned everybody at Alexandra Palace last year when he made it all the way to the final . VIDEO 'Snakebite' prepares the hair . James Wade . Wade has won all there is to win in darts, apart from the world title. He has never even appeared in the final at Alexandra Palace, twice losing in the semi-finals. Wade may never get a better chance at the title than in 2012, when he was 5-1 up in the semi-final against Lewis and somehow lost 6-5. Still, his experience and performances this year make it hard to exclude him from the list of contenders for the title. Should he get past Jamie Lewis in the first round, a potential second-round clash with BDO world champion Stephen Bunting could await him. James Wade has won every major trophy in the PDC apart from the World Championship . Stephen Bunting . The winner of the BDO title last year makes his debut in the PDC version of the world championship this year. He made the switch from the BDO to the PDC in January and produced solid, if not spectacular, results, including making the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and the German Masters. Bunting is the sixth favourite for the tournament, as his lowly No 27 seeding means he could be facing No 6 seed Wade in the second round. Stephen Bunting will make his debut at Alexandra Palace having won the BDO world title last year . Raymond van Barneveld . It has been a long time since Barney produced his best at the World Championship. Since winning the 2007 world title, the best Van Barneveld has managed is a final appearance in 2009 and semi-final defeats in 2010 and 2013. Barney is seeded as low as 14, which means a potential third-round clash with Lewis awaits him. But if the Premier League champion finds his groove at the oche, he will be a tough man to beat.

The 29-year-old is re-united with PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was in charge at Chelsea when they won the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. He had fallen out of favor under Andre Villas-Boas and was also a target for fellow EPL side Queens Park Rangers, but chose the Parisian giants. \"I knew about PSG's immense stature and that made me want to come,\" Alex told the club's official website. \"For the past two months I've wanted to leave Chelsea and we finally opened talks with PSG. Everything went very well.\" Alex has won 18 Brazil caps and was in their squad which claimed the 2007 Copa America, but he will be battling five other players, including club captain Mamadou Sakho, for places in central defense. \"I know him very well. He's a fantastic man and a fantastic player. He's a good investment for the team,\" said Ancelotti. Ancelotti, who took charge in December, also revealed that the Qatari-backed club had ruled out an immediate move for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez. The Italian said they had been in discussions with Tevez and his connections but talks had broken down. \"We discussed a move with the player but there is ultimately no agreement,\" Ancelotti told the club website, but left the door open for a future deal. Meanwhile, Tevez's advisor Kia Joorabchian told British radio station TalkSport that it was likely the striker would stay at City until the summer. \"We've been in negotiations with three big clubs but I don't think they have reached the figures Manchester City want,\" Joorabchian claimed. Joorabchian also said he believed his player could end up at PSG next season. \"PSG want to build a long-term project and I think Carlos is six months too early for them. But there is a big chance he will go there in the summer,\" he added.\""

Meanwhile, the search continued for more possible bodies at the filty, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, Massachusetts where four other children previously were removed into state custody. The two youngest children have been also receiving medical treatment after showing signs of long-term neglect. Scroll down for video . Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arraigned on Friday for charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths of the three babies found at the Massachusetts home . Murray's attorney said that her client is mentally ill. A not guilty plea was entered on her behalf today during her arraignment at Uxbridge District Court . Neither child has birth records. The three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds, the Boston Globe reported. A six-month-old baby is extremely sensitive to sunlight. The father of the children apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. Ms Murray appeared disheveled as she was arraigned in Uxbridge District Court on Friday morning. The judge agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance on reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month. Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, pointing to the conditions in the home, suggested that his client was mentally ill. She was held without bail, NECN reported and is due back in court on October 14. Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies on Thursday at the house in Blackstone, about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. Four other children had been removed from the home two weeks earlier. Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arrested on charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths. Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in 'deplorable condition.' He said authorities don't know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. The body of one infant was found inside a closet, police said. The two other babies were found on Thursday. Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment on Friday. She is being held without bail and is due back in court on October 14 . The infants were found dead inside the home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Thursday where four children were removed by authorities last month . Prosecutors said Murray, 31, would be arraigned on Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney. A spokesman for the Blackstone Police Chief  told the Boston Globe today that Murray is believed to be the mother of all seven children. The search of the home, which is just a couple hundred feet away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days. The four other children, ages 13, ten, three and six months old, were removed from the house on August 28 after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions. The prosecutor said one of them approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn't stop crying. Early said the six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed. Both 'condemned' and 'keep out' signs are attached behind police tape to the front door of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found Thursday in Blackstone . Emergency personal in protective clothing fold a tarp on the street in front of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found . Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits. 'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . An official described the interior of the home crawling with vermin, swarming with flies and covered in dirty diapers . The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in. 'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said. Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children. The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect. Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'. Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police. He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed. The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody. On Thursday, 31-year-old Erika Murray was arrested in connection with the appalling living condition but not over the children's deaths. Murray is facing several charges, including witness intimidation. She will be arraigned on Friday.\""

Tim Peake wants wants the public to help name his 2015 mission to the International Space Station . If you look up at the sky on a clear night, you may see a tiny white light moving across the sky. The light, often mistaken for a low aircraft, is in fact the International Space Station (ISS), hurtling around Earth at speeds of 17,500 miles per hour. Next year, British astronaut Tim Peake will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the ISS – and he wants the public to help name his mission. The journey will make him the first British astronaut to visit the International Space Station as well as the first official Brit in space. The competition, open to all residents of Esa’s member states, follows a long-held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a European astronaut goes into orbit. Previous mission names have included ‘Marco Polo’ for the Italian Astronaut Roberto Vittori and ‘Odissia’ for Belgian Frank de Winne. Major Peake, 41, said: ‘The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly. ‘My six month stay onboard mankind's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting. Tim Peake said: 'The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly' Before joining the Esa astronaut corps in 2009, Major Peake was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot. He was assigned his mission in May 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of Expedition 46/47 to the orbital outpost. He is following a long line of British explorers and scientists, from the North Pole and the Nile to the Himalayas and now to outer space. ;As a former test-pilot I believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible,' Major Peake said. ‘The scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging, covering areas such as medicine, human physiology, core science and material science.' The winning entry needs to be short – ideally one or two words or an acronym - and will be incorporated into a logo. Names that reflect an astronaut's nationality are encouraged, but they should also have a wider European flavour, and be easy to pronounce. A team of linguists will also check a shortlist of entries to make sure that seemingly innocent entries are not rude in another European language. Major Peak will then look at the remaining option to make the final choice. An early favourite is ’Beagle 3' - a successor to ‘Beagle 2’, which was the name of the UK's unsuccessful attempt to put a probe on the surface of Mars. Another suggestion is ‘Starman’, inspired by the song of that name by David Bowie. Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: ‘Tim’s flight is a reminder of humanity’s desire to explore new frontiers – and of the role that Britain has played in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. ‘The naming competition is just one of many opportunities for young people to get involved in a mission that will shape the future of Britain’s space programme and inspire generations.’ The competition closes on 4 April 2014 and can be entered here. Major Peake is due to go to the International Space Station towards the end of 2015 and will spend six months carrying out scientific experiments .\""

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"Editor's note: Zeyno Baran, a native of Turkey, is senior fellow for the Center for Islam, Democracy and the Future of the Muslim World at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank that says it is dedicated to \"global security, prosperity and freedom.\" From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center. Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan. (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start. His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy. That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward. Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral. With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help? Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together. Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women. No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences. Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing. Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies. There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions. Still, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States. To start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the \"Muslim world\" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea. Turkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices. Anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran.\""

A 40-vehicle convoy that seemed to be coming from the neighboring Dominican Republic headed into town Thursday afternoon on the Route Nationale in western Port-au-Prince. Escorted by heavily armed United Nations troops, the convoy had more than two dozen tractor-trailers, in addition to water and fuel tankers and even an armored car toward the back of the caravan. Some of the trucks carried the insignia of the Catholic Relief Services organization, while other vehicles bore markings identifying them as being from the Dominican Republic. Other aid and military vehicles traveled elsewhere in western Port-au-Prince, particularly on Boulevards T. L'Ouverture and 15 de Octobre. Residents as well as caregivers had complained earlier this week that aid was not getting out quickly enough. Full coverage | Twitter updates . For the second day in a row, the city gave indications of coming back to life. The sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks, and many small food stores were open. Dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut-filled dirt side street. A smaller market on a street corner saw some business. On the Route Nationale, residents crowded around the back of a parked brown semi-tractor trailer for hours before the back doors opened and local aid workers handed each person a six-pack of bottled water. The throng seemed relatively orderly, and no commotion was noticed. Long lines formed in front of some of the city's money-transfer offices, which opened for the first time since the January 12 quake that shattered large parts of Port-au-Prince. Haitians in line were there to pick up money sent to them from elsewhere, mainly the United States. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Streets were choked with tap-taps, the brightly painted small pickup trucks that have been converted into passenger minibuses, with 10 or 12 people sitting on two facing benches on the truck bed. Many tap-taps carry Christian inspirations such as \"Jesus saves\" on their windshields and have intricate designs and messages on the side walls. Haitian police and U.N. military vehicles were common, and local authorities seemed to take an increased posture. Five national police officers, easily identified by their camouflage uniforms, jumped out of their truck at an intersection in the Cite de Soleil neighborhood near the harbor. They investigated men at the rear of two small pickups stopped there. One officer dropped to his right knee and briefly pointed his rifle toward the men. He and the other officers then abruptly turned around and walked away a few seconds later. Impact Your World . Cite de Soleil is the poorest and roughest neighborhood in the city, known more for its rampant crime and violence than its poetic-sounding name. Like all other parts of Port-au-Prince, many residents say it has fallen into increasing disrepair since the 1980s. A nearby neighborhood, Carrefour, was once a tourist destination but has become a run-down, lower-class neighborhood.\""

The shooter, 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar, uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site Tumblr before the incident, police said Wednesday. The photo was taken in the dressing room of the The Mall in Columbia store where Aguilar would commit his crimes. In late January, Aguilar fatally shot Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, and injured a third person before turning the gun on himself. Police declined to release the photo, saying they believe Aguilar took it to gain notoriety and they won't honor that desire. Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said a message accompanying the picture read, in part; \"I had to do this.\" A police statement said Aguilar's account has been deactivated by Tumblr. Police verified previous reports that the shooter and the victims, one of whom worked at the skateboard apparel shop, were not acquainted. What was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe Aguilar had studied the Columbine shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there. \"Aguilar's weapon, attire, backpack containing explosives and method of suicide were all similar to those used in the Columbine incident, said a Howard County police statement. On April 20, 1999, two Columbine students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 of their classmates, a teacher and then themselves. The school is in Littleton, Colorado. McMahon said police have learned Aguilar began using the Internet last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools, gun laws and explosive techniques. He even downloaded a video game allowing players to act as one of the shooters from that day. Juxtaposed with those searches were inquiries about mental illness and visits to sites about suicide prevention. McMahon said Aguilar also sought help from his regular doctor because he said he was hearing voices. The doctor said he referred Aguilar to a psychiatrist, but it doesn't seem he ever made an appointment. The doctor told police Aguilar said those voices were non-violent and didn't direct him to do anything, authorities said. In December 2013, Aguilar purchased a shotgun at a shop just outside Washington, D.C. He was there with a friend, but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of Aguilar's future plans. Aguilar told his friend he was buying the gun for target practice. Police also recovered a journal which they said ultimately did not shed a lot of light on Aguilar's motives, but did give them some insight into his disturbed mind. In one entry, Aguilar wrote, \"I (sic) going to *expletive* kill you all in a couple of hours I'm anxious, I hate you all so much you are pathetic pieces of *expletive* who deserve to die. worthless you are all *expletive* worthless. Everything seems fake. I think that I may already be dead.\" Police said Aguilar fired a total of nine rounds, but came into the store with 54. \"Frankly, we're fortunate he took his own life rather than to run down the hallway and chase victims as they were leaving,\" McMahon told reporters. In the end, McMahon said, it's clear Aguilar thought he was suffering from a mental illness but was afraid to even tell his own mother. McMahon said he believes the discussion on mental health treatment must continue. \"Nobody saw this coming,\" McMahon said. \"He was a young man that didn't garner much attention to himself.\" Deadliest shootings in U.S. history . CNN's Joe Johns and Stacey Samuel contributed to this report.\""

After the debacle of investigator Michael Garcia disowning the summary of his own report by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the buck was passed to FIFA compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide the next step after reviewing all the documents. And FIFA hope Scala will put enough evidence from the full Garcia report to the executive committee meeting in Morocco next month for them to decide once and for all whether a re-vote is needed over the staging of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Michael Garcia is probing the conduct of five FIFA officials - including three who are still on the executive . But to complicate matters, Garcia is still probing the individual conduct of five people — three believed still to be on the executive, one a high-profile former member and another a powerful ex-FIFA official. And Zurich insiders believe it will be impossible for Scala to divulge fresh information from the Garcia file to the executive in Marrakech on December 18-19 — even with names redacted — without compromising Garcia’s inquiries, especially if they involve three people who will be in the room. Christmas looks to have been cancelled by Arsenal as far as their supporters are concerned. The traditional festive drinks with Arsenal fan groups may well be ditched this year, with the club seemingly sensitive to any criticism of under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger. Last year the Gunners waited until the day after their Christmas bash with fans before announcing ticket price rises. An Arsenal spokesman said they were organising a larger gathering of supporters for an end-of-season party. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen’s granddaughter Zara Phillips but has time on his hands after leaving his role coaching Gloucester, is understood to have signed up for a reality show.

The William Hill sports book of the year award has a habit of going to a rank outsider — indeed, the more obscure the better. Gareth Thomas’s autobiography and a Bobby Moore biography would probably be the favourites at Thursday’s ceremony but a book about running up and down Mt Kilimanjaro may beat them to the prize. Coe says 'oui' to IAAF . It has been assumed since Lord Coe said athletics was ‘in his DNA’ when turning down the chance to lead the BBC Trust that he preferred to run for the IAAF presidency. And it is understood Coe will announce in French sports newspaper L’Equipe that he is officially in the running to succeed Lamine Diack next August. The choice of a French media outlet suggests Coe is positioning himself as an international statesman rather than a British one and French is an important language in the athletics community. Lord Coe turned down the chance to lead the BBC Trust as he has aspirations to succeed Lamine Diack . Lord Moynihan, who has led the House of Lords’ all-party campaign to regulate the secondary ticket market, is hopeful that the Government will take notice of the peers winning a rare amendment. This would see greater transparency in online ticket selling in time for next autumn’s Rugby World Cup. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid is opposed to the changes but the Government response will be led by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, whose Secretary of State Vince Cable is the MP for Twickenham, of all places. The haphazard preparations for the 2016 Olympics in Rio include having to lengthen the iconic rowing course at Lagoa by 30 metres at the start and the finish to allow the requisite amount of slow-down water between the finish line and the end of the lake.

A multi-million dollar Hollywood movie is scrapping its promotional campaign - over fears it could be deemed insensitive following the shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin. Twentieth Century Fox has pulled the trailer for its comedy Neighborhood Watch because actor Jonah Hill's character makes a gun motion out of a car window. It has also axed a bullet riddled promotional poster for the film about a group of suburban fathers who become neighbourhood watch volunteers and end up battling aliens. Scroll down to see the scrapped trailer... Scrapped: Twentieth Century Fox has pulled this poster for Neighbourhood Watch because it could be deemed 'insensitive' in light of Trayvon Martin's shooting . Uproar: Trayvon Martin's (left) death prompted anger as George Zimmerman (right) has never been arrested . Banned: The trailer has also been consigned to the bin because actor Jonah Hill's character makes a gun motion out of a car window . The decision was taken after the 17-year-old was gunned down by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, 28, last month. Zimmerman claims he acted in self-defence after being sucker-punched by the teen in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. The fact Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters have marched at rallies across the U.S. Confusion now surrounds exactly what happened - with details emerging of the gunman's criminal past, and Trayvon's history of truancy, drugs and graffiti. Citizens on patrol: The stars of the film play suburban fathers who end up battling aliens . Stars: The film pairs Vince Vaughn with Ben Stiller once again. The duo appeared in the smash hit comedy Dodgeball . A Fox spokesman said: 'We are very . sensitive to the Trayvon Martin case, but our film is a broad alien . invasion comedy and bears absolutely no relation to the tragic events in . Florida. 'The movie, which is not scheduled for release for several months, was made and these initial marketing materials were released before this incident ever came to light. 'The teaser materials were part of an early phase of our marketing and were never planned for long term use.' Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, whose 2004 film Dodgeball raked in $115million at the U.S. box office, are joined by British comedian Richard Ayoade star for the movie. Fox said the posters for the July release were taken out of Florida cinemas this week and would be removed from those across the U.S. in the coming days. Decision: Fox said the posters for the July release were taken out of Florida cinemas this week and would be removed from those across the U.S. in the coming days . Moving on: The second stage of the promotional campaign, to be launched shortly, will focus on the 'alien invasion component of the film . They will be replaced with simple images of the cast. The second stage of the promotional campaign, to be launched shortly, will focus on the 'alien invasion component of the film', it added. It is not the first time a news event has scuppered promotion of a film. Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, featuring a tsunami, was pulled from the Japanese market by Warner Bros after last year's natural disaster. And the British release for V for Vendetta was delayed in 2005 after the London tube bombings eerily echoed a key plot point in the vigilante-themed film.\""

The teacher was identified as Mohamed Hussein, 45, a resident of the Qandho near the besieged town of Bulo Burde, 217 miles north of Mogadishu in central Somalia. \"The reason the Quran teacher was murdered is that he was one of the few residents that refused orders from Al-Shabaab to leave his village that was recently seized by Somali and AU troops,\" Durow said. Al-Shabaab had warned local residents to leave their houses in the towns they have seized, according to Durow. Last week, the militant group abducted and beheaded two Somali policewomen in the city of Teyeglow, located in the southwest region. The beheadings prompted a government soldier whose wife was among the victims to kill five Al-Shabaab wives in retaliation. Al-Shabaab also beheaded two government soldiers near the town of Bur Hakaba in the Bay region in south Somalia. Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state.

Self-starvation is excruciating, but as one of our clients expressed, this is the only way the men at Guantanamo have left to tell the world what it means to be unjustly detained without charge or trial for more than 11 years with no end in sight. The starvation protest, which began in February, has created headlines around the world. Of the 100 men, 23 are being force fed to keep them alive. As you read this, it's likely that some of the men are being dragged from their cells, strapped to restraint chairs, and a rubber tube inserted up their nose and into their stomachs to pump in liquid dietary supplement. One of the men described the traumatic experience to his attorney as having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat. Last week, 40 additional military medical personnel were sent to Guantanamo to assist with the force-feedings, a practice that the American Medical Association condemned as a violation of \"core ethical values of the medical profession\" and the United Nations condemned as torture and a breach of international law. Force-feedings at Guantanamo are nothing new, and much like indefinite detention, the practice has come to define the prison. In 2005, when the first mass hunger strike at the prison took place, the Bush administration also responded by having medical personnel force-feed the men. Back then the men were fighting for due process and access to attorneys; eight years later and with more than half the prison population cleared for release by the Obama administration itself, the men are asking for an end to their indefinite detention. As President Obama said last week, the prison is \"not necessary to keep America safe. It's expensive, it's inefficient, it hurts us in terms of international standing, it lessens cooperation with our allies in counterterrorism efforts.\" It is also illegal and inhumane, as the United Nations' top independent human rights experts and the international human rights body with jurisdiction over the United States, the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, reminded the president. I would like to believe that if the president could see what lawyers at my organization have witnessed during visits with our clients in the last few weeks, he would act without delay to make good on the promise he made to close Guantanamo Bay four years ago. The toll that starvation and the violence of force-feedings have taken on the men is painful to see. They have lost 30 to 40 pounds, they look skeletal, and many are losing consciousness and coughing up blood. Last we heard, one of our clients weighed 90 pounds. I'd like to believe that if President Obama knew a man like Djamel Ameziane, he would understand that closing the prison is not a matter of political expediency but life or death. Djamel has been cleared for release, the government has said there are no \"military rationales\" for detaining him further, and other countries have expressed an interest in resettling him because he fears persecution in his home country of Algeria. Yet he continues to languish in a cell years later. What does that do to a man's spirit? The president said he continues to believe \"we've got to close Guantanamo.\" But believing is not enough. Believing in the president and having their hopes for justice raised and dashed so many times since the order to close Guantanamo was first signed in 2009 is what drove the men at Guantanamo to put their lives on the line with this hunger strike. Guantanamo is back in the news in a serious way for the first time in years, and it is the men themselves who have succeeded in putting it there, using the only peaceful means they have available to them to demand their lives back. The president has more staff members force-feeding men whom his own administration cleared for release than he has working to transfer them out. It should not take the inevitable deaths that will follow from this crisis for the president to act. He must stop pretending Congress is preventing him from doing anything. Right now he has the authority that Congress provided under the National Defense Authorization Act to start transferring the men who have been cleared using a national security waiver. He also has the power to lift his self-imposed moratorium on transfers to Yemen. Collective punishment based on nationality is as illegal as indefinite detention. The president said the right things last week. He has said the right things before. All it takes now is the humanity and the will to act and end the horror that is Guantanamo prison. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vincent Warren.\""

President Obama has repeatedly expressed support for closing the prison, but has yet to act, and the men's hunger strike has highlighted the need for him to take decisive action to end the indefinite detention and force-feedings that have become synonymous with the prison."

Only five teams had previously managed to win all six group games in the competition. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti barks out some instructions during his side's 4-0 win over Ludogorets . 'It is not easy preparing for each game with the same levels of motivation and eagerness that these players are showing', Ancelotti said. 'After losing to Atletico (Madrid on September 13), I couldn't have imagined stringing together 19 consecutive wins. 'I was sure that the things that weren't going well would be fixed, but not to this extent. Cristiano Ronaldo hit his 72nd Champions League goal during the trouncing of Ludogorets . 'It is a result we have achieved with extraordinary seriousness and an incredible amount of professionalism. 'I know that I have an extraordinary group of players. 'I have a very good relationship with the players. I care a lot for them and I thank them for the work they're doing as much as I can.' Tuesday's win allowed Madrid to pass the consecutive wins mark of Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona, a side that won 18 straight games in the 2005-06 campaign. Gareth Bale leaped above Ludogorets' defence to score his side's second goal of the night . Ancelotti's squad are five wins away from equalling the world record of 24 straight victories set by Brazilian outfit Coritiba FC in 2011.

Roy Costner IV, the top graduate of Pickens County, South Carolina’s Liberty High School submitted one speech for approval prior to the recent ceremony, but ended up tearing it up before a shocked crowd and giving an altogether different address. But it wasn’t entirely impromptu. 'Obviously I didn't do my job well enough,' Costner said after telling the crowd his speech had been approved by faculty. 'We're going to have to use a different one. Who cares?' Then he ripped his speech in two. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Imbued: Valedictorian Roy Costner tore up his speech and chose to address the crowd with the Lord's Prayer . ‘Those that we look up to, they have . helped carve and mold us into the young adults that we are today,’ he began again. ‘I’m so glad that both of my . parents led me to the Lord at a young age. And I think most of you will . understand when I say…’ Costner paused, threw caution to the wind and began reciting a speech his audience had likely heard before. ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name…’ Costner’s approved convocation address suddenly sounded a whole lot like the Lord’s Prayer. Costner continued as the crowd’s initial spattering of applause became a roar: . ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’ Spirited: The crowd was shocked as Costner shredded his approved speech, but the shock soon turned to applause . ‘You couldn't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering,’ attendee Brian Hoover told KSBW. But Costner pressed on, righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd. ‘For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever…Amen.’ The teenager’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and, presumably, graduations. The rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction, as it was widely perceived as a ‘ban on prayer in schools.’ Misconception? Costner went rogue, apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring 'sectarian' from school gatherings, a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the South Carolina county's schools . Pickens County School District superintendent Kelly Pew clarified the rule in a March blog post: . ‘What I find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the Board or the District want to “ban” prayer from our schools,’ she writes. ‘The difference between the Board taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation, and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign, is vast.’ Despite going rogue in the face of the county’s decision, Costner won’t be facing any disciplinary action. According to a school publication, WYFF reports, Costner will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree at nearby Clemson University in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘computer programmer overseas.’\""

Earlier tests in 2006 and 2009 drew worldwide condemnation, Security Council sanctions and led Pyongyang to withdraw from the six-party talks. In resolution 2087, passed on January 22, the Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea for its December 12 space missile launch and made clear that new violations would be dealt with harshly. In response, North Korea rejected Council legitimacy, asserted their right to nuclear weapons and deterrence and proclaimed it would soon conduct a new nuclear test. In addition the North engaged in some strong saber-rattling aimed at South Korea. Because some analysts believe this will be a uranium explosion, it is a game-changer for the region and poses new and unfavorable challenges to the Security Council. A successful uranium test indicates that Pyongyang has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems. It means that North Korea, if left unchecked, can both produce and export such material, raising new concerns that Pyongyang and Iran cooperate in such developments. Politically the test will reveal that the new regime of Kim Jong-Un exceeds the defiance to U.N. dictates of his predecessors in pursuing his nation's nuclear goals. Neither the prospect of stronger sanctions, nor the growing discontent of Russia and China with his behavior, appears to deter North Korea's young leader. OPINION: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke . These dilemmas confront the permanent five members of the Council with a harsh reality check regarding their unity of action and what message to convey to the north via what particular sanctions. If the Council follows the logic of resolution 2087, it will impose more extensive and punishing sanctions than ever before. Such sanctions will blacklist companies, government agencies and individuals long known for their role in illicit technology procurement and sanctions evasion. They will expand financial sanctions into areas of banking that would require substantial transnational enforcement to bite, and they may call upon countries in the region to inspect almost all North Korean trade. The economic squeeze and further isolation of the DPRK will increase substantially. These sanctions would require China to play an enforcement role against North Korean economic actors it has hitherto resisted. Seizing prohibited goods that pass through Dalian harbor and other trans-shipment points, as well as shutting down various border activities, would also fall to China. These extensive sanctions as punishment operate from the assumption that at some point the north will forego its nuclear program in order to survive as an authoritarian state. But there may be an alternative to the punishment approach that could bring Beijing on board with effective Council action. China might well accept specialized trade sanctions aimed to degrade the DPRK's ability to sustain the nuclear program for lack of material and due to prohibitive costs of sanctions busting, as a way of conveying to Pyongyang that it must return to the negotiating table. The logic of extensive new product-focused sanctions is that DPRK can make -- or jerry-rig -- only a small fraction of the advanced technologies and specialty materials that sustain an ongoing uranium enrichment program. To choke off these materials -- and the illicit means of financing them -- provides the Council with a possibility to make it technically impossible for DPRK to have a functioning uranium-based bomb program. Precise lists of dozens of the materials used in centrifuge operation that should be sanctioned are already recorded for the Council in the reports of their Panel of Experts for the DPRK. Lists of related materials have also been developed by the Nuclear Supplies Group. To date the permanent five have sanctioned only a very few of the materials on either list. The Council also needs member states to strengthen export, customs and financial controls on dual-use items that are \"below grade\" of those newly sanctioned items. This will stifle the North's ability to upgrade or jerry-rig these hitherto unsanctioned items as a way of maintaining their program. Also critical to the success of this choking of supplies would be stricter controls of the illicit financing that supports such trade. Putting strong enforcement behind the 2087 resolution's concern about DPRK cash flows, especially through its embassies, is also in order. Another, somewhat unprecedented, sanctions option would be a Council-issued travel ban on North Korea placed on all scientists, engineers and others with specialized expertise in centrifuge technologies and uranium enrichment. Political agreement on these measures will not be easy to attain among the permanent five nations of the Security Council. But a product-focused sanctions approach -- especially leveraged to aim for more direct diplomatic engagement with the DPRK while denying them material to grow their illicit programs -- has the best chance of gaining Council consensus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George A. Lopez.\""

The graffiti - a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers as though he's just been stood up - was discovered early this morning on the roller door at the Hustler Club at 641 West 51st Street. His caption reads: 'Waiting in vain... at the door of the club.' Scroll down for video . Back to work: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's work due to 'police activity' but he was back brightening up the streets of New York today, with a fresh piece, pictured, on the side of a Hell's Kitchen strip club . Club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it. According to the Gothamist, Wright has been letting Banksy fans pose with the piece 'if (they) ask him nicely.' Today, is the 24th day of the British street artist's month-long open-air residency in New York City, Better Out Than In. There are only 7 days left. The Hustler Club's New York Marketing . Director, Steve Karel, told Gothamist this afternoon: 'We're honored . that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt's Hustler Club New York to share his . art. Honored: 'Honored' club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determined how best to preserve it . 'We respect the art and artist; while we'd love to leave the work in place, it's required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future—hopefully inside of the club.' Bansky revealed NYPD officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day. The world-renowned street artist cancelled Wednesday's artwork after New York officials urged people to file . complaints against the London-based man of mystery and boosted NYPD patrols looking for graffiti. The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: 'Today's art has been cancelled due to police activity.' On hiatus: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's artwork, it remains to be seen if he will resume his month-long one-man show . Early rumors swirled around the city . that the anonymous artist had been arrested, but those were shot down by . an NYPD spokesperson who spoke to Gothamist. The . website has announced the locations of each day's work for his 'Better . Out Than In,' graffiti spree across the city this month. No further details were given. Just last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg bemoaned Banksy's month-long 'residency' on the city's streets. 'Nobody's . a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,' the mayor told media. 'I . just think there are some places for art and some places where… no art.' Street sculpture: British street artist Banksy's October 22 addition to his New York residency was this foam and cement sphinx in Willets Point, Queens, though it wasn't there long . 'Running . up to somebody's property or public property and defacing it is not my . definition of art,' the billionaire mayor continued. 'Or it may be art, . but it should not be permitted, and I think that's exactly what the law . says.' Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s month-long street show. Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader's work. When a painting of a beaver popped up on an east New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it. But he might be getting the richest from the found art. WATCH MORE AT THE UNDERGROUND FX . 'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' Veles told the New York Post. Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but 'I don't want to say more,' he said. Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside. As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled 'all the way!' in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off. Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum . Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said. One of Veles' workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars. 'You don't own it,' screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd. 'Are you looking to start something,' the worker said in Requena's face. 'I don’t want to fight,' said Requena. 'We just want to take pictures and you're blocking it.' Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces. For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.' On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled  'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St . Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting . Banksy's Monday offering to the streets of New York is this picture of a young boy writing graffiti in the South Bronx, 153rd Street and Elton Avenue, while being served by a waiter in tails . And in Greenwich Village, two Banksy works, 'Sirens of the Lambs' and 'Shoe Shining Ronald McDonald' made a rare appearance together outside a McDonald's .\""

Nose hacked off, mutilated ears hidden by her dark hair, it was the magazine cover that horrified the world. But for Aesha Mohammadzai, the Afghan girl tortured by her husband for attempting to escape their abusive forced marriage, that extraordinary and harrowing Time magazine cover was just the start of the story. Four years on, she faces a new battle – a struggle to put the disturbing experiences behind her as she attempts to make a new life for herself in America. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Aesha, won political asylum in 2011, having fled to the U.S. a year earlier, aged just 18, after being promised reconstructive surgery. She arrived without speaking a word of English and illiterate in her mother tongue of Pashto. Since then she has undergone pioneering reconstructive surgery to give her a prosthetic nose and been given the education denied women back in her homeland under the Taliban. However, it appears the psychological scars from her ordeal have proven harder to heal. Those who have become close to Aesha have spoken of her displaying volatile mood swings – oscillating between violent tantrums and displaying deep affection to people around her . Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Her plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy surgery required. Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Aisha has a prosthetic nose fitted using a special adhesive. She will eventually have reconstructive surgery . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'\""

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"Mohamad Chatah, a former Lebanese finance minister and ambassador to the United States, died Friday when a car bomb struck his convoy in downtown Beirut, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. The blast killed six others and left 71 wounded, Lebanon's state news agency said. Cars were burned beyond recognition as a wall of flames and thick black smoke shot up from the blast site. Chatah's bodyguard, Mohammed Badr, was among those killed, the news agency said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Chatah's last tweet, posted about an hour before his death, talked about Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based Shiite militant group with which Chatah was at odds. \"#Hezbollah is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security & foreign policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 yrs,\" Chatah tweeted. That group decried the attack in a statement aired on Hezbollah TV, saying the it \"only benefits the enemies of Lebanon.\" The group called on \"all the security and judicial agencies to be on high alert to expose the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\" Chatah was known as a staunch critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he accused of meddling in Lebanon's internal affairs. Hezbollah has sent fighters to help al-Assad's forces in the Syrian civil war. \"A united and  peaceful Syria ruled by Assad is simply not possible anymore. It has been like that for some time,\" Chatah wrote in his last blog post. \"The status quo ante cannot be restored. Iran and Hezbollah realize this more than anyone else.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the killing of Chatah, whom he called \"a voice of reason, responsibility and moderation.\" \"His presence will be missed, but his vision for a united Lebanon, free from sectarian violence and destabilizing interference, will continue to guide our efforts,\" Kerry said in a written statement.  \"Indeed, his tragic end reminds all of us just why his vision remains so imperative.\" Syrian war spills over into Lebanon . More than 100,000 people have died in Syria's civil war in which al-Assad's forces are battling rebels seeking an end to his family's four-decade dynasty. Al-Assad and the core of his regime are Alawites, members of an offshoot of Shiite Islam, but most Syrians and a large portion of the rebels are Sunni. The war has spilled across the border into Lebanon. Dozens have been killed there in largely sectarian violence, including dual bombings last month that left 23 dead in Beirut. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a Sunni jihadist group linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for those bombings. The group warned that more attacks would come unless Hezbollah stopped sending fighters to support Syrian regime forces. Chatah graduated from American University in Beirut and was Lebanon's ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 1999, according to his blog. Chatah also was a senior adviser for former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and was the finance minister in former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's Cabinet in 2008 and 2009. Hariri issued a statement Friday condemning the killing, calling it \"yet another terrorist message sent to us, we the free men of Lebanon in the Future Movement and March 14 coalition.\" Hariri's \"March 14 coalition\" is a pro-Western, Sunni-dominated bloc. It takes its name from the day in 2005 when thousands gathered in Beirut a month after the assassination of Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, to demand an end to the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Saad Hariri said the bombers \"want to assassinate Lebanon and humiliate and weaken the State.\" \"The signatories of the message do not hide their fingerprints,\" he said. \"They will continue on the criminal path and will insist on dragging Lebanon into the abyss of discord, as long as there is in Lebanon some who provide cover for those crimes, who ask to bury the heads in the sand and who justify the proliferation of weapons and the rise of the armed groups at the expense of the State and its institutions.\" On Friday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati posted a tweet saying he is calling off his vacation and heading back to Lebanon. \"I condemn this assassination, which targeted a political, an academic, a moderate and an upscale figure who always believed in dialogue and the language of reason, logic and the right to have a different opinion,\" Mikati said. Chatah was married and had two children. His death comes 20 days before the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon begins the trial of four Hezbollah suspects over the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri. Like Chatah, Hariri was also killed in a car bombing.\""

And though the families of those lost made yet another pilgrimage to Washington this week to plead for action in meetings with the two top House Republicans, it is highly unlikely that lawmakers will act. After the meeting Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner said the discussions were \"very good.\" Boehner declined to say much more about the discussion with the group, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who was also at the meeting, told reporters, \"I was struck again by the incredible pain that they are going through. I just can't imagine as a parent that kind of pain. My heart goes out to them.\" Backers of gun control proposals were unable to advance legislation in the Senate centered on expanded background checks earlier this year, even after a high-profile push. The House never took up the measures. President Barack Obama lashed out when the Senate effort faltered, calling the defeat a \"pretty shameful day for Washington.\" The political climate isn't right. Politically vulnerable moderate Democrats eyeing the 2014 midterm elections don't want to risk political capital by voting to pass both an immigration overhaul and comprehensive gun control legislation, said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's recent move to discourage funding the four Democratic senators who voted against shoring up background checks on gun sales will largely amount to a \"symbolic\" gesture, Gergen said. Two of the four -- Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, -- are facing re-election in 2014. Leading Democrats are also dubious about the overall impact of such a move. \"The only way to pass a background check bill is to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate, and any efforts that make that less likely are counterproductive,\" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"Ninety percent of Democrats agree with the 90% of Americans who support background checks, and a Republican majority would guarantee that no background check bill passes in the foreseeable future,\" he said. There's also no incentive for the Republican-controlled House to take up gun control as an issue. That chamber's leaders have said they won't bring the matter up until the Senate acts. In either case, it seems as if the nation has moved on. Though national polls taken after the Newtown shooting showed that roughly 90% of Americans supported some form of universal background checks, less than half of those polled were upset by the Senate's failure to pass that type of measure, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. \"I'm afraid the moment has probably passed,\" Gergen said. After the Newtown shooting, gun control advocates redoubled their efforts with a nation mourning the loss of school children. The issue also galvanized the Obama administration. However, they have thus-far been outmatched by efforts of a powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group, the National Rifle Association, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. However, this year's defeat may could still result in eventual legislative change, Vernick said. In the absence of congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks, many states have taken matters into their own hands. While some states like Connecticut and New York have strengthened laws, others have done the opposite. Undaunted by congressional inaction, the White House is still pushing for tighter laws. Vice President Joe Biden recently shared his confidence that Congress will act with fellow Democrats in an e-mail and chastised Republicans during a recent fundraiser for not supporting expanded background checks for gun sales. Biden is also holding a gun control event at the White House next week. Biden, a former senator, and Reid are also reportedly in talks on how best to resurrect related legislation. \"I am not going to bring up a vote just to have a vote,\" Reid said last week. \"I want to bring up this vote again if we can accomplish something that seems pretty common sense to me. If you have severe mental problems or you are a criminal you shouldn't be able to buy a gun. That's what, I agree with 90% of the American people, we should get this done.\" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.\""

Admission: Nigel Farage said he opened an offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill but never used it . Nigel Farage was today branded a 'hypocrite' after admitting he opened an  offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill while campaigning against tax avoidance. The leader of the UK Independence Party set up a scheme on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’. But he claimed he never used it saying: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’ Mr Farage told fellow members of the European Parliament last month that they had a ‘common enemy – rich people, successful companies evading tax’. Labour MP John Spellar said: 'I know Nigel Farage wants to appeal to disaffected Tories, but copying some of the Tories' biggest donors by using offshore trusts to avoid tax is taking things too far. 'It's typical of UKIP - they talk about how much they love this country, but they don't even bank here - it's just hypocritical.' While Mr Farage's trust is within the law, he has attacked Brussels bureaucrats on £100,000 a year who pay just 12 per cent tax on their income. He said: ‘It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, how can that be fair?’ Mr Farage, a former City commodities trader, created the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654 ten years ago, according to documents seen by the Daily Mirror. Accounts reveal he owned shares in this trust briefly during 2004, having transferred shareholdings from his trading firm – Farage Ltd. That meant the offshore trust owned 50 per cent of his firm. He set up the trust with his brother Andrew, who pocketed £969,000 in dividends from his trading firm. Mistake: Mr Farage said that setting up the account was a mistake because he is 'not rich enough' An embarrassed Mr Farage said: ‘My . financial advisors recommended I did it, to have a trust really for . inheritance purposes and I took the advice and I set it up. It was a . mistake. 'I was a completely unsuitable person for it. I am not blaming them it was my fault.’ The . UKIP leader said it was an ‘educational trust’ to ‘build up a trust . fund for your children or grandchildren’s school fees, things like . that’. Costly: Tax avoidance has been top of Prime Minister David Cameron's agenda at this week's G8 summit in Northern Ireland . But he added: ‘Firstly, I’m not rich enough to need one and I am never going to be. ‘Secondly frankly the world’s changed. Things that we thought were absolutely fair practice ten, 20 years ago aren’t any more. 'Thirdly, it was a mistake because it cost me money, I sent a cheque to set it up.’ Tax avoidance has been at the top of David Cameron’s agenda at this week’s G8 summit in Northern Ireland. It is estimated to cost Britain £35billion a year. Mr Farage’s accountant confirmed all the dividends were paid to Andrew Farage, who insisted he had paid all his taxes. He added: ‘I packed up business completely in 2004.’ Nigel Farage declared to the EU Parliament in January 2004 that he was a paid director of Farage Ltd. He became UKIP leader in 2006, and his EU register states he was paid for commodity broking every year from 2004 to 2009 when this was his only business appointment according to Companies House records. He remained a shareholder in Farage Ltd until 2011. It is now subject to a ‘voluntary order’ – one step from bankruptcy’ and has debts of more than £130,000 to be paid off by 2017. There is no inheritance tax and most companies pay no corporation tax on the Isle of Man where tax avoidance is a huge industry.\""

The director of a new film has been forced into a grovelling apology after he sent out a promotional pack including a balaclava, nails and a roll of duct tape. The film, A Belfast Story, is about paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and is set in a post-Troubles Belfast which is still marred by violence. Starring Irish actor Colm Meaney the film is meant to the reality of modern Belfast. But film writers were horrified when they received the press pack full of unsavoury accessories leading Northern Irish writer Chris Hewitt, of Empire magazine, to brand it 'the most distasteful freebie ever.' A Belfast Story: The film is set in modern day Belfast which is shows as still marred by violence, pictured an attack by Nationalist groups in the Ardoyne area of Belfast in 2009 . In evident dismay Hewitt tweeted that he had received 'a box containing a bag of nails (for a nail bomb) and a balaclava, for A Belfast Story. Not quite sure what point whoever sent it is trying to make. But I'm pretty sure it's a moronic one.' The promotional boxes, which also feature fake newspaper clippings and surveillance photos, were sent to media outlets including Belfast’s UTV. The plot of the film, follows Meaney playing a weary detective tasked with investigating the murders of former paramilitaries. It was written and directed by Nathan Todd, a former engineering student at Queen's University, Belfast. Todd told the BBC that the purpose of the packs was not to frighten or offend people. In a conversation with the BBC Good Morning Ulster programme he said: 'The idea was to interest people in a movie we were making which is essentially the story of the two choices which face Belfast, do we engage retribution or reconciliation. 'Obviously, the intention is not to offend anyone. We apologise if we did. 'The intention is to raise awareness for something that we did, that delves into some legitimate questions and tells some interesting stories about the city and the country.' Dark days: But the press packs containing nails, balaclavas and duct tape were too close to home for some including Empire reporter Christ Hewitt . Split psyche Northern Ireland: The producers of the film say the pack was meant to represent the realist of modern Belfast . But whatever the justification for the stunt was many like Mr Hewitt no seem inclined to give the film exploring 'a life after terrorism' a miss. Mr Hewitt remains unimpressed by the apology and told the Independent: 'I’d like to sit down with whoever came up with that little brainwave and explain to them what growing up during The Troubles was like. 'I’m now not going to see it. There is such a thing as bad publicity.' Teri Kelly, a publicist for the movie, which opens next month, said the press kit had been sent out by the producers to represent the divisions that remain in Northern Ireland’s psyche. He said: 'It was sent out to show the two sides of the film, reconciliation and retribution. 'There are two sides to the box and one side represents retribution and violence and one side represents turning away from violence. It tries to show the dichotomy within Northern Ireland.' The press kit appears to be the most ludicrous promotional movie stunt since a Missouri cinema hired a gunman in full tactical gear to storm an Iron Man 3 screening in May. Terrified audience members called police, fearing they had stumbled into a repeat of the Colorado cinema shooting which left 12 dead during a premiere screening of The Dark Knight Rises last year.\""

But more than simply upsetting the status quo, according to one of the country's leading rappers their music was the \"fuel\" for Tunisia's revolution. \"Balti\" is Tunisia's best-known rapper and one of the founding fathers of hip-hop music in the country. His most popular videos have reached 350,000 hits on YouTube and he's performed to audiences of over 50,000, sharing the stage with such Western rap idols as Method Man. His latest recording is \"Zine el Abadine Ben Ali and the 40 Thieves,\" a barbed account of the former president deceiving his people. Rappers risked the wrath of the authorities under the Ben Ali regime, writing and recording in secret studios. Balti says he was arrested and briefly jailed in 2005 for a song which wasn't one of his. In recent years Tunisian rappers have taken advantage of social networks to post music videos on the internet. Most notably, a rap by 21-year-old Hamada Ben Amor -- known as \"El General\" -- went viral after he was arrested by armed police at his home in the eastern coastal town of Sfax and taken to Tunis for interrogation. The song \"Mr President Your People Are Dying\" was a personal message to President Ben Ali outlining the corruption and deprivations besetting the Tunisian people. Eight days later \"El General\" had been released and Ben Ali had fled the country. Inside the Middle East traveled to a recording studio in the suburbs of Tunis where Balti makes his music to get his take on the role of rap in Tunisia's revolution. IME: How difficult was it to make music before the revolution and how has that changed now? Balti: Rap and hip-hop in Tunisia before the January 14th revolution was very difficult. It was forbidden by the old regime and some people were jailed. Rappers such as Philosoph, Ouled Bled and myself stood up to those difficulties and made our voice heard. Hip-hop music has contributed greatly to the revolution in Tunisia. The revolution started on the internet. Thank you to Facebook and guys like El General and Psyco M -- they spoke before and after January 14th and contributed to break the fear barrier among youngsters. The revolution is a social movement and rap is always talking about social issues. We come from very tough neighborhoods and we talk in our songs about social problems such as unemployment. We feel like our voices didn't get to the regime, to the top officials, but thank God our voices were heard by the people, so we were the fuel of our revolution. IME: Do you expect hip-hop to explode in Tunisia now you have more freedom? Balti: Yes, I welcome the new generation of rappers. Everybody has their own style and we will compete, but I am very glad that we will have a new rap scene. I think that rap music and hip-hop has a good future in Tunisia. Along with Psyco M and El General there are many other rappers who didn't get their opportunity before the revolution and now is the time to have their chance. IME: What are your thoughts about what's happened in other parts of the region since the revolution in Tunisia? Balti: I'm so happy to see other Arab countries looking to get back their freedom, and not just because I'm a Tunisian, but because Tunisia played a leading role in this matter. My message to them is to do things in a peaceful way. Yes, you can ask for your freedom and a job, but you can do it in a peaceful way. You can also ask for regime change -- it's the people's basic right to remove it. I want to emphasize, do it in a peaceful way. Don't let a lot of people die and lose your wealth by destroying your economy. IME: How do you see the future for Tunisia? Balti: This revolution has been made by the youth of Tunisia. They are the ones who stood up against the old regime and asked for their freedom of speech. The whole nation is happy about the revolution but after every revolution there are some economic and political problems such as unemployment, but we should stick together to make this happen. The stone which brought down the government we can use to rebuild the country.\""

Today she has combined her beauty knowledge with her love of fitness to create the world's first face gym, a non-invasive finger-led facelift that recreates a typical gym workout with a warm-up, interval training and cool down stage. Speaking to MailOnline about the . concept, which has just launched in Selfridges as part of its Beauty . Project and been hailed a key beauty trend for 2014, Inge explained that . she has suffered several distressing treatments over the years so . wanted to go back to basics and swap injections for good old-fashioned . face massage. Workout for your face: A new concept called Face Gym has launched in Selfridges and mimics a gym class to tone your face and beat wrinkles . She said: 'Face Gym is grounded in the principal that we don’t think twice about toning our muscles at the gym so why think differently about the face? 'Facial muscles are crucial to the way we look and with regular stimulation can lift, tone and tighten the skin, boost blood circulation and collagen production giving a fresh youthful appearance to the skin. Beauty buff: Inge Theron worked as the Financial Times' undercover Spa Junkie for four years and has now unveiled the world's first face gym, which she promises is the ultimate non-invasive, finger facelift . 'There are over 650 muscles in the human body with roughly 50 concentrated in the face, it takes approximately 43 to frown, 17 to smile, but without proper stimulation, face muscles are prone to sagging. 'Face Gym . goes beyond the skin - our face trainers work deep into the muscles . around key problem areas such as jowls, eyes and foreheads.' The . signature £35 30 minute treatment consists of a warm up, cardio, . and cool down with £15 (10 minute) add-ons available o target specific . treatment areas. Inge . uses techniques she learnt from her sessions at celebrity favourite . Barry's Bootcamp and the Skinny B***h Collective, which focus on . interval training to make your muscles lengthen. Inge and her team use facial flicking, pummeling and fast finger movements to lift the cheeks, drain excess fluid from under the eyes and work on fine lines. She refuses to call it a . 'facial', maintaining that it is more about 'sets, reps and packs'. The session promises to deliver results immediately, but Inge recommends . going once a week for very visible results. If you're looking to take . the workout to the next level, Inge and her team offer 'mouth work', a . 20 minute in-mouth massage, which promises to relieve tension and widen . the mouth palette. While . Inge is the first person to bring this concept to the beauty market, . face massage has been practiced in ancient cultures for centuries and . was once the secret of Chinese Empresses practiced 3,000 years ago to . increase circulation of blood and 'chi' to the face.

The Italy goalkeeper has long been a mainstay at the Turin club following his move from Parma in 2001 and he had little to do at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, but it would prove to be a miserable night for the 36-year-old, who was wearing a special armband to commemorate his milestone. Antonini, who was introduced from the bench in the 81st minute, bundled home in added-on time as Juve were made to pay for wasting a string of chances as they saw their unbeaten record and three-point lead at the Serie A summit disappear following Roma's 2-0 win over Cesena. Gianluigi Buffon's 500th Serie A appearance for Juventus ended with defeat on Wednesday night . Luca Antonini gave Genoa the win as Juventus' fine start to the season was dented . Carlos Tevez looks dejected during the defeat as Juve wasted a string of chances . Buffon was wearing a special captain's armband to mark his 500th appearance . The capital club moved level on points with the reigning champions as they remained perfect at the Stadio Olimpico. Mattia Destro's eighth-minute goal put the hosts on their way before Daniele De Rossi made it 2-0 nine minutes from time. AC Milan took advantage of defeats for Udinese and Sampdoria to move up to third following a 1-1 draw at Cagliari. Filippo Inzaghi's men did it the hard way as Giacomo Bonventura's 34th-minute strike cancelled out Victor Ibarbo's opener 10 minutes earlier while the Sardinian side wasted several chances to grab a second-half winner, with Daniele Conti coming closest when he hit a post. Sampdoria suffered their first defeat of the season as Mauro Icardi's last-minute penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory. Mattias Destro was on target as Roma beat Cesena 2-0 to maintain their perfect record at the Stadio Olimpico . Yet they remain in fourth position as Udinese dropped two places following a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina. Khouma Babacar scored either side of half-time, while Fiorentina mainstay Borja Valero scored the final goal of the evening to boost La Viola into the top half of the Serie A table. Gonzalo Higuain struck four minutes from time as Napoli made it six games unbeaten in the league with a 1-1 draw at Atalanta, who took the lead just before the hour through German Denis but had Luca Cigarini sent off in the 83rd minute. Palermo claimed just their second win of the season as Luca Rigoni's 81st-minute strike gave them a 1-0 victory over Chievo, while Matteo Darmian's 10th-minute goal ensured victory by the same margin for Torino over Parma, who remain rooted to the foot of the standings and whose misery was compounded when Alex Cordaz was sent off from the bench for dissent.\""

Some look forward to a romantic dinner or a special gift, while others treat it like any other day. Whatever the case, how you approach this nationally recognized \"holiday\" reflects your expectations within your relationship, experts say. \"It varies from couple to couple, but usually the way you feel about it is a metaphor for your expectations of the relationship,\" said family psychotherapist Fran Walfish. If someone's more easygoing and has low expectations, it says something about his or her ability to be flexible and adaptable, she said. On the other hand, if a husband expects the wife to surprise him with dinner at a restaurant he's secretly dying to go to, it shows that he sets the bar high in the relationship and expects her to deliver, Walfish said. It doesn't hurt to use Valentine's Day as an opportunity to step up your game and show you care, but don't let the relationship live or die based on this day alone, she said. \"The affirmation and declaration of love is not in a gift or in one day. It's a 365-day year experience of feeling like your partner has an interest and desire to know your wants and comfort level.\" What couples do also tends to evolve depending on the stage of the relationship. CNN's team of feature writers and producers solicited feedback from Facebook and beyond on how folks plan to observe Valentine's Day, if at all, with bonus information on nontraditional relationships. Young love . For new couples, Valentine's Day is a good opportunity to set the record straight as far as expectations, with an open, honest discussion, which could help determine whether the relationship's going to work, Walfish said. Among our Facebook friends, that means dinner or drinks at a place they've been dying to try. A card, candy, or a thoughtful gift might be involved to let your partner know you're serious. If Valentine's Day occurs early in the relationship, the female tends to expect more from the guy, and he's probably stressing out over the situation, said Blaire Allison, \"The Love Guru,\" who coaches people in matters of the heart. \"When you're first starting a relationship, there's always that fear factor involved because the guy doesn't want to disappoint the girl, but he but doesn't want to do something over the top that'll scare her off,\" Allison said. The DINKS (double-income, no kids) Married or not, this ain't their first rodeo, and they tend to know what they want out of the evening. Plus, having no kids means more time, money and flexibility to do whatever you want. To us, it kind of seems like the best situation for doing something for the holiday, as it elicited the most diverse responses. For some, it meant date night at Carnegie Hall or steak frites and a night in a hotel. A friend who's a vegan chef is making a special meatless meal for her sweetie, complete with chocolate cookies with raspberry jam centers. Eatocracy managing editor Kat Kinsman says she and her husband buy each other Scotch or Madiran wine, and he cooks the same meal every year: steak (the first year, it was heart-shaped), pattypan squash, hen of the woods mushrooms. Another constant: \"There is NEVER a restaurant involved.\" When money is tight, a bouquet of flowers does the trick, one friend said, as they're \"cheaper than jewelry and healthier than chocolate.\" Speaking of thoughtful and unhealthy, one person who flew home from a conference in Chicago brought a deep-dish pizza back to her significant other. Married with children . Children might change priorities in a relationship, but that makes Valentine's Day the perfect opportunity for a couple to reclaim some time just for themselves, Walfish said. \"Many people who've been married for a long time can get lazy and stuck in a rut and don't want to take the energy and initiative,\" she said. \"If there's no time to get away, after the children go to sleep, plan to be together and not in pajamas and take the time to make good eye contact and commit.\" Things are a bit different for one friend now that he and his wife have a toddler. But he still writes a poem for his wife and they make handmade gifts for each other. Another friend and her husband have cut back on dinners out since the birth of their daughter and purchasing a new home, but they still exchange cards. The long haul . Eventually, the children grow up and leave the nest, if all goes according to plan. For some, it's an opportunity to reclaim life as a couple. Dinner and flowers are generally a part of the celebration, with special enhancements when possible, said a relative who lives in Europe. In recent years, the couple have spent weekends in Barcelona, Spain, and Oxford, England. The husband bought a picture for his wife of two people walking in a park together that reminded him of them. \"All the more special since I gave it to her on Valentine's Day,\" he said. \"Still my favorite picture.\" Nontraditional relationships . Not every relationship fits into one of those categories, but that doesn't mean nontraditional lovers don't want to celebrate their relationships just like the rest. Take, for example, polyamorous \"families,\" which consist of multiple romantic partners, from as few as three to north of 20 in some instances. \"Each of my partners is like those in any monogamous relationships,\" said Shara Smith, a representative of the Polyamory Media Association, which provides members of the press with information and spokespeople on how polyamory works. \"There's really no difference between how I feel about my current partners or how we relate to each other. The only difference is I didn't have to break up with one to start the other.\" Smith, her three male partners and their additional \"metamors\" are going out for dinner at a nice steakhouse in Tampa, Florida. All told, there will be six of them around the table. \"I don't personally observe Valentine's Day, but my partners' other partners do,\" she said. \"The holiday's not important, but making my loved ones feel that I care about them is important.\"\""

French league leader Lyon hosts second-place PSG on Sunday, and the French champions will climb into first if they win. The well-traveled Ibrahimovic, who has played in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and his native Sweden, is returning to form after recovering from a nagging heel injury. Zlatan Ibrahimovic in action against Lille in the French League Cup on Tuesday night . Fournier thinks referee Clement Turpin should brace himself for a difficult time dealing with the notoriously fiery Ibrahimovic, who has won league titles with Juventus, Barcelona, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Ajax, and two-time defending champion PSG. 'The person who is going to be most provoked is rather Mr Turpin, like all the referees in this league who get insulted by this person,' Fournier said on Friday at a pre-match news conference. 'Apparently, the referees are not bilingual or trilingual, so they don't understand. In a way, it's better to speak Italian or English to insult referees.' The PSG striker stretches his leg as he tries to pull the ball out of the air . The game could be a turning point in the season, and opposes Lyon's tight unit of largely homegrown players with the expensive signings of a PSG side sometimes found wanting for team spirit. Fournier has warned his players to keep their composure - and to stay respectful. 'I don't want (our team) to provoke, I don't want us to insult the officials,' he said. 'I hope we remember not to fall for Zlatan's provocations.' Ibrahimovic has suffered an injury hit season but is now getting back to his best . PSG's confidence is high following six straight wins, while Lyon has been dealt a double blow by the injury-enforced absences of 21-goal league top-scorer Alexandre Lacazette and key center half Milan Bisevac both out injured. Lacazette won't be sidelined for long by a hamstring injury, but Bisevac is out for the rest of the season with a knee injury, meaning Lyon have to try and contain Ibrahimovic with a makeshift center-half pairing.\""

A woman who cried rape was jailed yesterday after a court heard it was her eleventh false claim. Compulsive liar Elizabeth Jones, 22, was exposed when CCTV footage disproved her allegation against a man she ‘did not like any more’. She had made her first false rape claim in 2004 when she was just 13, Southampton Crown Court heard. Between 2005 and 2007 she made another eight allegations which police investigated and dismissed, although she was not prosecuted. In 2009 she was sentenced to a ten-month detention and training order for a similar offence. Jones’s latest victim was a boyfriend against whom she made the allegation after the pair had an argument. Police began an investigation after Jones, from Southampton, persuaded a friend to report she had been assaulted. She later went to the police station for a medical examination and repeated her allegation. The man was arrested and questioned for nine hours before being released without charge. Prosecutor Jennie Rickman said he denied rape and detectives later viewed CCTV covering part of the house in which Jones claimed to have been attacked. The video did not support her story that the man forced himself on her. Miss Rickman said: ‘There is a history of her making false allegations of this nature and this is the 11th incident. ‘Police had to take her allegation seriously and carried out an appropriate investigation. ‘She was later arrested and accepted she had lied about being raped. She said she did it because she did not like him.’ Jones admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 16 months. Judge Derwin Hope said the offence was . not only serious because of ‘the terrible emotional experience’ the man . she accused had to endure, but also because it struck at the heart of . the criminal justice system. In mitigation, Megan Topliss said Jones had . had a disturbed childhood and had been in care. Fabricated: Southampton Crown Court heard that her latest victim was accused because she did not like him . When confronted by police, Jones . immediately accepted she had lied and pleaded guilty at the earliest . opportunity, Miss Topliss said. Outside court, Detective Constable Tim . Blanche of Southampton’s Public Protection Department, who led the . investigation, said that Jones had a ‘complex life’. Of the case, he said: ‘There was intimate contact between the couple, but they didn’t live together.’ The pair had an argument and Jones . made the fabricated rape allegation. ‘The man was arrested and he gave a . statement. He had to live his life with people accusing him of being a . rapist,’ Detective Constable Blanche said. When the man heard Jones had been . jailed for 16 months ‘he was disappointed and felt that the time wasn’t . long enough after what she put him through’. Detective Constable Blanche added: ‘After the previous ten false allegations, Judge Hope felt that it was the final straw. ‘The evidence in the case was so . conclusive as the CCTV images were so clear. I imagine that with the . previous allegations the evidence hasn’t been there. ‘We take rape allegations very seriously and those that make false claims need to face the consequences. ‘False allegations completely . undermine the work that the police have done and make it harder for . genuine rape victims to come forward.’\""

Police arrested Derrick Shelby after using a stun gun on him three times, according to a supplemental police report. Shelby, 25, who is in his third season with the team, was at a Fort Lauderdale dance club early Saturday when security guards told police he was causing a disturbance, the affidavit says. Shelby was \"touching females at location without their permission,\" it says. Security removed him from the club, and a police officer told him several times to stop obstructing a roadway and the club entrance. Shelby refused, according to police, and asked the officer, \"What are you going to do?\" Appearing to be intoxicated, he began filming and photographing the officer, who called for backup, the affidavit states. Shelby was again asked to leave and refused before police told him he was under arrest for trespassing. \"Upon attempting to place Shelby into custody he began pushing away from officers and took an aggressive fighting stance,\" the affidavit says. \"Shelby was placed on the ground, where he was actively resisting and attempting to brace his arms to defeat efforts to place him into custody.\" Shelby was \"overpowering officers,\" according to the supplemental report, so an officer used a stun gun on him, but to no effect because of \"the proximity of the prongs on his back.\" The officer used the stun gun on him again in the right shoulder, \"which was temporarily effective in gaining more control over Shelby, but he immediately returned to actively resisting and trying to free his other hand,\" the report says. After police stunned Shelby a third time, they were able to take him into custody and transport him to a local hospital and then the Broward Sheriff's Office jail. He was charged with resisting without violence and trespass after warning, both misdemeanors, police documents say. He was released on a $100 bond, according to CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. A mug shot released by the sheriff's office shows a bloodied Shelby with obvious injuries to his lip and left cheek. A woman at defense attorney Daniel Rosenberg's office said Rosenberg was in court Monday morning and would comment later. Phone and email messages weren't immediately returned, but Rosenberg told The Miami Herald that Shelby \"maintains his innocence\" and said the mug shot \"speaks volumes,\" considering the charge of resisting without violence. The Dolphins suspended the former University of Utah player indefinitely \"for conduct detrimental to the team,\" according to a news release. \"We were disappointed to learn about Derrick's arrest,\" head coach Joe Philbin said in a statement. \"Based on my conversations with Derrick and the information we have thus far, Derrick will be placed on Indefinite Club Suspension. When we have completed all of the necessary diligence, we will make a final determination on his discipline.\" The Dolphins were off this weekend after traveling to London in week four to play the Oakland Raiders. The arrest marks yet more negative publicity for the NFL, which has seen numerous players in recent weeks suspended or placed on voluntary leave after alleged instances of domestic or child abuse. Fort Lauderdale police documents do not elaborate on the allegation that Shelby was touching women at the club, saying only that security alleged he did not have their permission. CNN's Vivian Kuo and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.\""

British workers face a bigger financial shock in retirement than their counterparts on the Continent thanks to our proportionally low state pension, a study has claimed. Research carried out by the think-tank International Longevity Centre UK (ILC) looked at how much elderly Britons get and how this compares to the income of workers. It found the figure paid here – £113.10 a week – is typically only one third of the average working person’s income after more than 40 years in the workforce. Proportionally, this makes it one of the least generous state pension schemes in Europe. As a result, people who retire without a private pension or any other form of nest egg receive a sudden financial shock, making it difficult to cover bills such as heat, light, food and transport. By comparison, the state pension in the rest of the EU works out at around half the national income. Some countries are even more generous, with the Italians getting 60 per cent of the average working wage. Workers in Greece currently get a figure equal to the working wage – although they do have a lower average working wage than the UK and their public finances are in greater disarray. The study also found that the UK has a greater number of pensioners at risk of poverty, 16 per cent, compared to a European average of 13 per cent. But the report concluded that the picture was not entirely gloomy for older people in the UK. It pointed out that the Winter Fuel Allowance has had a positive impact on pensioners’ quality of life – with only 3 per cent of old people here complaining about living in cold homes, compared to European average of 12 per cent, and a staggering 52 per cent of those in sunny Portugal. The ILC has argued for the scrapping of the traditional concept of retirement with efforts to encourage older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills. To the workhouse with you old man! The International Longevity Centre UK, which carried out the research, has argued for older people to remain in the workforce and earning money to cover their bills . Helen Creighton, of the ILC UK, said: ‘Different countries have their own strengths and weaknesses. ‘While the UK has a good record on warm homes, thanks to the success of the Winter Fuel Allowance, Nordic countries have the best record on keeping older people in employment, which leads to higher incomes and fewer problems of social isolation. ‘The Government aspires for the UK to be the best place in the world to grow old. But while the UK is by no means the worst place in Europe to grow old, we’ ve got a lot to do to top the European league. ‘The Government is right to aspire to be the best. But to achieve that we must look at and learn lessons from our European colleagues.’ She added: ‘Europe’s ageing has profound implications for individuals, governments and businesses, and the UK must adapt to a Continent where it is projected that almost one in three people will be over the age of 65, and more than 1 in 10 will be over the age of 80 by 2060.’ Richard Willets, Director of Longevity at Partnership, which sells annuities to cover elderly care costs, said: ‘As with the UK, the rest of Europe is rapidly going grey. 'This raises a unique set of challenges for government, business and individuals who not only need to plan for their own later life but also need to put structures in place that will help society at large.’\""

She fled from her house in Burnley, Lancashire, with children Isabel, eight, and six-year-old son Ayrton, who had been asleep upstairs. She said: 'I shouted for the kids to wake up. I was screaming, telling Izzy to get her brother up and to tell them to get to the front door. 'I got the dogs, a bichon called Mojo and a shi tzu called Dot, and was behind them. I put them in the car and rang the fire brigade. 'We have lived here for around two years. I had just got it how I wanted it. Everything is gone. The only place that's not touched is the kitchen.'

She added: 'There will be no TVs or games consoles in the bedrooms from now on.' She heard a smoke alarm and rushed upstairs to find flames shooting from the charger on the bed where Ayrton had originally wanted to sleep before cuddling up to his sister in another bedroom. The family did not have home insurance, and face a costly repair bill, as well as having to replace most of their belongings. But the community has rallied round to launch a Facebook group, 'Help Mary and her 2 children', which has attracted 500 members, appealing for donations of clothes, toys and furniture. Her brother-in-law, Paul Booth, ran from his home in nearby Gainsborough Avenue after hearing about the fire. The 29-year-old father-of-two said: 'I woke my kids up, left them with a neighbour, and ran around. 'I shouted, \"are the kids out?\" - but they were. Seconds later the fire brigade turned up. 'She is very lucky. If the fire alarm did not go off, she would not have known.' Another picture of Mary Disley's room where the fire originated.

Yesterday, Ms Disley and her children went back to examine the damage after spending the night at her brother's house. Every bedroom was covered in thick soot, while several downstairs rooms had severe water damage. The children's clothes and toys have been badly damaged or destroyed. Mary added: 'I started studying social science at the University of Central Lancashire this week, and I got a laptop for my birthday, which is on Saturday, off my sister. Mary Disley with her children Isabel, 8, and Ayrton, 6 - who she woke up and pulled from the burning house . The few remaining toys owned by Isabel and Ayrton that were not destroyed in the massive fire. Their mother has now vowed to never use TVs or game consoles in bedrooms again . 'It was the first time I had it so I put it on charge on the bed and went to watch the rest of Coronation Street before doing my uni work.' Two crews from Burnley were called to the blaze, which ripped through the bedroom in just minutes. Firefighters used breathing apparatus, a thermal-imaging camera, and hose reels to put the fire out. Others climbed a ladder to attack the flames through the bedroom window. An investigation confirmed the fire was caused by 'an overheating laptop power pack which had been left on the bed.' A fire service spokesman said: 'On this occasion, the actions of Mary must be commended and we cannot stress enough the importance of smoke detection in people's property which, on this occasion, has undoubtedly saved lives. 'Electrical items such as hairdryers, straighteners, laptops, and tablets, should not be left on bedding when switched on and should be switched off when not in use.' Mary Disley's brother Paul Booth (pictured) said his sister was 'very lucky' the smoke alarms had sounded . Barrowford Primary School's headteacher Rachel Tomlinson has called for residents to help the family back on their feet. Writing on Facebook, she said: 'Just heard some sad news that a member of our community lost her house and all her belongings in a fire on Monday night. 'Thank goodness, she and her children are safe. I know there will be many friends who want to, and be able to, help. 'If anyone can help with clothes and maybe toys or other household items, please drop them off at school. 'I never cease to be amazed at what we can do for people in this situation.' Donations can be dropped off at the school, in Rushton Street, while World of Plastering, in Grafton Street, Nelson, and the Queen Victoria pub, in Colne Road, are also acting as drop-off points.\""

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton has been meeting with advisers at her Chappaqua, New York home for strategy sessions about launching a 2016 presidential run, a Democratic source tells CNN. The meetings have taken place for part of the last month, according to the source, and have focused on the strategy, tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful. \"She has got a lot of depth in policy, but she is looking for new ideas,\" the source said. \"She is also being very thorough about the path to the nomination and the path to the presidency. There are a lot of strategy meetings with tactics focused on that.\" Democrats attending some of these meetings -- which were first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday -- include Joel Benenson, Jim Margolis and Robby Mook, according to the source, who noted that all three operatives had been selected to play major roles in the Clinton campaign. In the run up to what is now an all-but-certain 2016 announcement, Benenson has been tapped chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, according to reports from the Washington Post and Politico. The source said that specific title has not been solidified yet, but the Democratic pollster is playing a big role in this pre-campaign process. \"She [Clinton] likes him for more than just reading poll results,\" the source said, noting that he would play a larger role than campaign pollster. The Clinton pre-campaign has also selected Mook -- a veteran of Clinton's 2008 campaign -- as their campaign manger, according to the source, and Margolis -- a senior adviser to Obama's successful 2012 reelection bid -- as media adviser. Both selections have been expected by Democrats close to Clinton and been previously reported. John Podesta, a top White House adviser who is slated to leave the White House in early February, has also been named campaign chairman, the source said. Politico was first to report his top campaign slot. \"He will be the chairman and the issue right now is if everyone will report to him as the chairman,\" the source said. \"I don't think he will be a titular head. I think the issue is is he going to be in charge of the campaign with authority and the intention is that he will be very active.\" Podesta, a former top aide in Bill Clinton's White House, joined the Obama White House in 2013 to help on major projects and negotiations. Recently he has since been blunt about the fact he planned to leave the administration in early 2015 to help a possible Clinton campaign. \"If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do,\" Podesta said on the Charlie Rose Show in November. \"Right now she hasn't made a decision to run, so I am expecting to return to what I was doing before.\" Clinton's meetings at her home in New York seemingly explain her month long absence from the speaking circuit and Twitter. The former secretary of state has gone over a month without a high-profile speaking gig, a dearth in events that is noticeable considering how many event Clinton headlined last year. Clinton will headline her first event in over a month on Wednesday in Winnipeg, Canada. Although some structural decisions have been made, the source said the Clinton camp has not solidified the overall architecture of the operation as well as heads of the communications, field and digital operations. \"There are these structural things to do and then, really I think once that is done, the thing she is going to end up spending a lot of time on is her plan and her message,\" the source said. Clinton's 2016 team, though early, is already shaping up to be a departure from the team that surrounded her in her during her failed 2008 presidential run. Instead, Clinton is pulling heavily from Democrats who successfully won Obama the White House twice. Republicans seeking to tie Clinton and Obama have welcomed that fact, arguing that by hiring former Obama advisers, Clinton is making their job easy. In a memo from America Rising, an anti-Clinton super PAC, Tim Miller, the group's executive director, said \"Clinton is signaling that she's not just from the same party as the President, but that she's an Obama Democrat, who will back his policies, pursue his agenda, and represent a Third Term of the Obama Administration.\" Emails to the a Clinton spokesman about the meetings and hiring went unanswered.\""

Yakov Lapitsky recorded 'Me at the Zoo', an 18-second video of his friend shot in front of elephants in San Diego, on April 23 that year, becoming the first person to shoot for YouTube. The video, which has now been viewed more than 17million times, would transform the way that people use the Internet, watch television and communicate with each other over the past ten years. The site is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its domain name today. Scroll down for video . Yakov Lapitsky, now 34, unknowingly shot the first ever video uploaded to YouTube in 2005, a clip of his friend Jawed Karim (pictured) at the San Diego Zoo. The site turns 10 years old today . Mr Lapitsky, now 34, was working as a doctoral student at the University of Delaware when he shot his friend Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo speaking about the elephants' trunks. He didn't even know about the video going up on YouTube until a month after his trip to California when Mr Karim posted it, according to the Toledo Blade. Mr Karim, now 36, along with PayPal coworkers Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, had registered the domain name YouTube earlier that year. The site would officially launch in November 2005, quickly racking up more than a million viewers per month by the next summer. Now more than 1billion users use YouTube everyday and 300 hours of video, 60,000 times longer than the zoo clip, are uploaded every minute. 'I didn't think much of it other than it was pretty adorable,' Mr Lapitsky, now an environmental engineering professor at University of Toledo, told the New York Daily News. What started as cute videos quickly became lucrative, and tech giant Google bought the company in 2006 for $1.65billion, when it was still unprofitable. Founders Mr Hurley, Mr Chen and Mr Karim are all now in different ventures. Mr Karim (left) has since moved on to other ventures after YouTube, which sold to Google in 2006. Mr Lapitsky (right), a doctoral student in Delaware in 2005, is now a professor of environmental engineering in Toledo . YouTube founders Chad Hurley (left) and Steve Chen (pictured in 2008) helped officially launch the video-sharing website in November, 2005 . The site is now used for applications as diverse presidential debates, official music videos, web television series, clips of people's pets and Internet-only news outlets. It has expanded to 75 countries and 61 languages and had $3.6billion in net revenue in 2013. The video sharing service is expected to reach $18.5billion in revenue yearly by 2019, according to Forbes. But the beginnings of the site were small, with individuals uploading their grainy camera footage by bits and bytes at a time. The beginning days of YouTube were not dominated by music videos, and independent producers such as Adam Quick posted grainy self-shot videos (pictured) Adam Quick, then 25, posted a video called 'Vernal Lullaby' in the first week of the site's experimental launch in May promoting a band called QOTSA. The music video was the 15th ever video on the site. Many of the first videos were silly snapshots of life captured on camera, people propping themselves up on corridor walls or a man getting his head shaved. 'It kind of blew us away,' Mr Quirk said. 'The videos just went straight up there to YouTube. It was pretty big for me.' YouTube now has copyright agreements with major record companies, and most of the most popular videos are from artists' official accounts. An entire economy has sprung up from independent content producers receiving money from companies to advertise or mention products on their channels. 1. PSY - GANGNAM STYLE (강남스타일) M/V . 2.24billion views since July 15, 2012 . Psy's music video for Gangnam Style spread far beyond the artist's home country of South Korea and became the most watched video of all time on YouTube . 2. Justin Bieber - Baby ft. Ludacris . 1.37billion views since February 19, 2010 . 3. Katy Perry - Dark Horse (Official) ft. Juicy J . 819million views since February 20, 2014 . Katy Perry's 2014 music video for Dark Horse has generated a huge number of hits in a relatively short time frame, recently surpassing LMFAO's son Party Rock Anthem on the most-viewed list . 4. LMFAO - Party Rock Anthem ft. Lauren Bennett, GoonRock . 818million views since March 8, 2011 . 5. Charlie Bit My Finger - Again ! 811 million views since May 22, 2007 .

Shirley Temple, pictured in 1947 at the age of 19, became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935 when she was six years old . The actress and singer, was born in the Californian beach town of Santa Monica on April 23, 1928, the third child of George Temple, afterwards a branch bank manager, and his wife Gertrude. Gertrude Temple had wanted to be a ballerina but had grown too tall - so channeled her thwarted ambitions into her daughter. Shirley Temple was just three years old when she was spotted by talent scouts at dance school and appeared on screen for the first time, in the one-reel short 'Poverty Row'. But it was the 1934 film Bright Eyes that made her famous.

At the year's end she had entered the list of the world's top ten money-making stars at number eight. She became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935, at the age of six. Her handprints were placed in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood along with the biggest stars of the day. She was the world's number one box-office star from 1935 to 1938 - leaving Clark Gable trailing in second place. Her earnings were placed into a trust - during that time all she ever saw was $13 a month in allowance. Her mother, Gertrude, worked to keep her daughter from being . spoiled by fame and was a constant presence during filming. Her daughter . said years later that her mother had been furious when a director once . sent her off on an errand and then got the child to cry for a scene by . frightening her. 'She never again left me alone on a set,' she said. Temple went on to star in films such . as Curly Top and The Littlest Rebel, helping the U.S. cope with the . Great Depression of the 1930s. Temple became a nationwide sensation. Mothers dressed their little girls like her, and a line of dolls was launched that are now highly sought-after collectables. Her immense popularity prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to say that 'as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right'. 'When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles,' Roosevelt said. She was credited with helping save the film . company 20th Century Fox, which owed $42million, from bankruptcy. In Britain, the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, were avid Temple fans. She even had a drink named after her, an appropriately sweet and innocent cocktail of ginger ale and grenadine, topped with a maraschino cherry. Her career faltered in 1939 . after Fox refused to loan her to MGM, she lost the lead in The Wizard of . Oz to Judy Garland. However she struggled to maintain her cinematic career in adulthood, though she continued to work in television.

John Agar, a sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps, in 1945 when she was just 17 years old. He is the father of her daughter Linda. The couple divorced four years later after the marriage disintegrated due to Agar's drinking and infidelity. On holiday in Honolulu in 1950 she met and fell in love with California businessman Charles Alden Black, nine years her senior, who confessed that he had never seen one of her films. They were married in December of that year and their son Charles Jr was born in 1952 and daughter Lori in 1954. They lived for many years in the San Francisco suburb of Woodside. The couple were married for 55 years until Charles passed away in August 2005 at the age of 86 from complications from a bone marrow disease. She described him as the 'love of her life' and kept his voice on the couple's answering machine. In 2006, when receiving a lifetime achievement award a few months after Charles had died, the veteran star said that her greatest roles were as wife, mother and grandmother. 'There's nothing like real love. Nothing,' she added. Star amongst stars: The actress appeared in the Bachelor Knight in 1947 with Grant again and Myrna Loy .

Child stars Shirley Temple and Baby LeRoy pictured on a 'date' in 1934 . Although she had mostly retired from showbiz, by the early 1960s Temple's interest in politics soon brought her back into the spotlight. She made an unsuccessful bid as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967. After Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he appointed her as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. In the 1970s, she was U.S. ambassador to Ghana and later U.S. chief of protocol. She then served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the administration of the first President Bush. A few months after she arrived in Prague in mid-1989, communist rule was overthrown in Czechoslovakia as the Iron Curtain collapsed across Eastern Europe. A change of direction: Shirley Temple speaking on behalf of the Republican National Commitee in London in 1968 . 'My main job (initially) was human rights, trying to keep people like future President Vaclav Havel out of jail,' she said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. Within months, she was accompanying Havel, the former dissident playwright, when he came to Washington as his country's new president. She considered her background in entertainment an asset to her political career. 'Politicians are actors too, don't you think?' she once said. 'Usually if you like people and you're outgoing, not a shy little thing, you can do pretty well in politics.' Ms Temple Black was also a delegate to . several international commissions and was involved with the United . Nations. She was the first woman to serve as US chief of protocol in the . Department of State. Her public service saw her on the advisory . council and board of directors for numerous organisations involved with . anything from criminal justice to health charities or wildlife bodies. She also sat on the board of directors for the Bank Of California and . the Walt Disney Company. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranking of the top 50 screen legends placed Temple at No. 18 in a list of 25 actresses. Moving on: Following the end of her entertainment career, Shirley, pictured in 1979, served as a U.S. ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia . Second marriage: Shirley pictured with her husband Charles Black, who died August 2005, in April 1950, months before their wedding . In 2006, Temple received the Screen . Actors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award for having 'lived the most . remarkable life, as the brilliant performer the world came to know when . she was just a child to the dedicated public servant who has served her . country both at home and abroad for 30 years'. At the awards, Temple quipped: 'I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to receive the lifetime achievement award. Start early.' The world's most famous child star had a surprisingly modest take on her achievements. 'I . class myself with Rin Tin Tin,' she said once, referring to the canine . star. 'At the end of the Depression, people were perhaps looking for . something to cheer themselves up. They fell in love with a dog and a . little girl. It won't happen again.' She is survived by her children Susan, Charles Jr, and Lori, granddaughter Teresa and great-granddaughters Lily and Emma. Proud: The star picked up the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award just nine years ago . Shirley Temple, the world's most famous child star, passed away on Monday at home surrounded by family.

The extravagant ten-bedroom home, known as Casa Casuarina, was originally built in 1930 and features a 54-foot long mosaic pool . lined with 24-karat gold, numerous frescos, ornate . statues, arched doorways and an open air courtyard.

Gianni Versace's former home in South Beach, known by most as Casa Casuarina, was sold at auction today to the firm behind fashion label Jordache for $41.5million . Design marvel: Though the designer behind Villa by Barton G, refurbished the 23,000 square foot space, the style is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner . Palatial: Peter Loftin, a telecom entrepreneur, bought the mansion in 2000 and resided there before its conversion into a boutique hotel in 2009 . The 23,000-square-foot mansion had . previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in . November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. In 1997, the 50-year-old Versace was . killed in front of the property by a man who later committed suicide. Tourists can still routinely be spotted taking photos in front of the . house. The property had been operating as a ten-room boutique hotel but had closed. The . house - whose most recent owner was telecoms magnate Peter Loftin - had . its asking price cut by $50million after failing to find a buyer for . more than a year. He initially asked $125million for . the property, making it the most expensive house on the market when it . was first put up for sale a year ago. Bargain! The mansion had previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. Its last asking price before auction was $50million .

Unique: There are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where Versace lived until his death . Pool: But only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the Miami Beach mansion . Dark past: It was outside this house where legendary designer Versace was killed by a lone gunman . But in November he was forced to take $25million off the asking price, and he then lowered it by another $25million six months later. Mr . Loftin bought the luxury mansion in 2000, three years after Versace's . murder, and converted the residence into a boutique hotel and private . club in 2009. Those who have toured the incredible . property maintain that the once gold-lined swimming pool and museum quality . frescoes are just a few of the lavish features that contribute to the . hefty price tag. In fact, such is its value, property experts refer to the luxurious villa as a 'trophy property'. Boutique: The Versace motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites, a tribute to the designer who spent $33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992 . Prints and patterns: The villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in Santo Domingo . Lavish: The hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by Mr Versace, a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag . Ocean view: Villa by Barton G looks out onto the Atlantic from its Miami Beach location, an exclusive section of the South Beach strip . A step in the wrong direction: Mr Versace was tragically killed at the entrance to Casa Casuarina in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan who committed suicide shortly after . The now legendary Italian designer . bought Casa Casuarina in 1992 for just under $10million after supposedly passing by and falling in love with it. Originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman, the Miami Beach property was somewhat dilapidated until Versace invested $33million into restoring and improving it. Once an architect himself, the . flamboyant designer added a 6,100-square-foot south wing and a 54-foot pool . lined with 24 karat gold. Illuminating: A skylight brightens up the original interior designed by Gianni Versace in the famously ornate home that he bought in 1992 after falling in love with the property . Grandeur: The couturier added a 6,100-square-foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles . Guest suite? The property cost Mr Versace $10million and though he plugged $33million of his own money into its renovation, after his death his family made a quick sale for only $20million to its most recent owner . Residential palace: The one-acre property features ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse . The impressive courtyard he covered in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles while elaborate . frescoes were painted across the property's walls and ceilings. Icon: Missed by the fashion world, the late Gianni Versace was once an architect . Indeed it was Versace's pride . and joy until the fateful June day of 1997 when Andrew Cunanan . assassinated him in cold blood on the very steps of the house. When Donatella Versace scrambled to sell . off the designer's assets, Mr Loftin gained from a quick bargain and . bought the villa for a cool $20million. After residing there himself for a . number of years, he turned the opulent property into a boutique hotel. The property is now known as Villa . by Barton G after the events impresario Barton G Weiss who renovated and re-styled it . Nowadays, according to the hotel's website, the decor 'takes up style where fashion designer Gianni Versace left off.' Boasting 23,400 square feet, the ornate . house includes seven fireplaces, a guest house and a parking garage . large enough for a dozen cars, and all within a one acre plot. For the past three years hotel guests have enjoyed the surrounding attractions of Miami's historic Art Deco district while re-energizing from the day poolside or in one of two of the residence's lounges.

The eight-page document released to the public contains a list of possible witnesses and law enforcement reports that could be used in the prosecution's case against Zimmerman. But it doesn't include details from those statements or reports, and contains no new revelations about the case, which sparked nationwide protests and reflection on race relations and gun laws in the United States. The document is part of the routine exchange of information between prosecutors and defense attorneys that occurs before trials. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said Monday on the website set up to release information from Zimmerman's side that his office had received \"67 compact discs and numerous hardcopy documents\" from prosecutors, including many of the records and statements mentioned in the summary. \"Please remember and understand that it is inappropriate for us to comment on particular pieces of evidence,\" O'Mara said in the website statement. Zimmerman, 28, is accused of killing Martin on February 26 as the African-American teenager walked back to the Sanford, Florida, house where he was staying, after visiting a convenience store. Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic, killed Martin unjustly after profiling him. Zimmerman, who acknowledges shooting Martin but claims self-defense, has entered a not guilty plea in the case, which has not yet been scheduled for trial. A timeline of the case against George Zimmerman . The document lists 50 possible law enforcement witnesses, including 28 officers from the 140-member Sanford Police Department. It also lists 28 civilian witnesses, including Martin's brother, mother and father, two of Zimmerman's friends -- Joe Oliver and Frank Taffe -- and his father, Robert Zimmerman. Prosecutors did not give names for 22 other potential civilian witnesses. Attorneys have previously expressed concern about publicly identifying some witnesses who may fear retribution for their roles in the case, which has inflamed passions among supporters of both Martin and Zimmerman. At least one of the witness interviews was conducted by Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump, according to the document. Evidence taken from Zimmerman after the shooting, including his weapon, bullets, clothes, a DNA sample, medical records and his cell phone data were also included in the disclosure to defense attorneys, according to the document. The document indicates that police technicians in biological and DNA evidence, trace evidence, gunshot residue, fingerprints and firearms may testify, along with two FBI agents, as well as two audio technicians who analyzed emergency calls made during the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin in an effort to determine who was heard screaming in the background. Experts Tom Owen and Edward Primeau concluded that the screams did not come from Zimmerman, who told police that Martin rushed him after they exchanged words, knocked him to the ground and repeatedly hit his head against the concrete sidewalk. Martin, who lived in Miami, died after a chance encounter with Zimmerman in the gated community where he was staying with his father during a suspension from school. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person walking on the streets of the neighborhood, which had been struck by several burglaries in recent months. Prosecutors say he disregarded a dispatcher's advice not to follow the person, who turned out to be Martin, and shot him after a confrontation minutes later. While Zimmerman supporters have characterized him as a well-meaning neighborhood watch volunteer who was only trying to protect his community, Martin's family and supporters have said he unfairly profiled Martin as a troublemaker just because he was an African-American teenager walking down the street wearing a hoodie. Sanford police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, saying there was no evidence to contradict Zimmerman's claim of self-defense under Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death. After weeks of protests demanding Zimmerman's arrest, a special prosecutor appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott filed the second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman. He was arrested April 11 and briefly jailed. He has returned to hiding after his release on $150,000 bond.\""

Scandal: Craig Thomson is accused of using a union credit card when he was a union official to pay for prositutes . An Australian MP has been accused of using an official credit card to pay for prostitutes, sparking a political scandal that could bring down the government. New South Wales state police said they are looking into new evidence that Craig Thomson misused a trade union credit card when he was a senior union official in 2005 and 2007. A conviction for theft or fraud would force Mr Thomson to quit parliament and cost Prime Minister Julia Gillard's year-old government its single-seat majority. With opinion polls showing the government has become deeply unpopular, observers agree that the ruling Labor Party would have little hope of retaining Mr Thomson's seat in an ensuing by-election. Mr Thomson has denied any wrongdoing and Ms Gillard has publicly supported the MP, who was first elected when Labor swept to power in 2007. The allegation, first raised by a Sydney newspaper in 2009, dates back to when Mr Thomson was national secretary of the Health Services Union. He allegedly used his union credit card to pay a Sydney brothel thousands of dollars of union money in two transactions. Mr Thomson has denied the allegation and claimed that an unnamed man had taken his credit card and forged his signature. He also said that that man had repaid the money. Under threat: Julia Gillard, pictured with Prince Charles ahead of the royal wedding in April, could lose her government's one-seat majority . Mr Thomson sued the newspaper's owner, Fairfax Media Publications, but dropped that court action in May. Police have never investigated the allegations because the Health Services Union, which is aligned with Labor, has never made a complaint. But an opposition senator, George Brandis, wrote to Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione yesterday with new evidence he said showed Mr Thomson had committed a range of crimes, including fraud, which is punishable by 10 years in prison. The new evidence included a statement from a forensic handwriting expert who said Mr Thomson had probably signed one of the brothel credit card dockets in question. It also included a bundle of recently released court documents that Fairfax would have used in the defamation trial as proof of many more instances in which Thomson allegedly paid prostitutes with the same credit card. When asked in parliament to comment on the growing scandal, Ms Gillard said: 'It would be inappropriate for me to comment further.' She denied any involvement in a decision by a Labor state branch to pay toward Mr Thomson's legal bills for settling his defamation case, adding: 'Decisions about finances related to the New South Wales Labor Party are for the New South Wales Labor Party to make.' The party will not explain the generous gift, but the opposition is convinced it was to prevent Mr Thomson being bankrupted by his legal bills. Under Australia's constitution, an MP must quit Parliament if he or she is bankrupt or convicted of a crime that carries a potential prison sentence of at least 12 months.\""

Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became locked in a bin battle with neighbour Gary Jones, 58, after claiming he blocked her parking space with his garbage. Heated words escalated after Jones smeared grease over Ms Dowling's bin handles before later allegedly lunging at her in her own home. Garbage wars: Trainee solicitor Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became embroiled in a bitter dispute with next-door neighbour Gary Jones (R), 58, over their wheelie bins . According to trainee solicitor Ms Dowling, she had initially politely requested her next-door neighbour refrain from leaving his rubbish in front of her property. After tensions mounted between the pair, Jones began to coat the handles of her wheelie bins with thick grease, preventing her from opening the lid to dispose of her garbage on collection days. The extraordinary row came to a head when Ms Dowling opened her bin one day and found it was full of her neighbour's rubbish. Jones and his family had filled it with leftover party decorations and half a birthday cake and when Ms Dowling found it, she flung it on to her neighbour's doorstep in anger. She was then confronted by her neighbour's screaming daughters and later, a furious Jones banged on her door and allegedly lunged at her when she opened it, pushing her on to her sofa. The father was arrested and ordered to appear in court - where he was banned from having any contact with Ms Dowling for three years. Sparked row: The 18-month dispute began when Ms Dowling complained that Jones was blocking her parking space with his wheelie bin . Extreme measures: Jones smeared grease (L) over Ms Dowling's bin handles to prevent her from being able to open the lid. The row came to a head when she tossed a half-eaten birthday cake on his doorstep (R) Ms Dowling said: 'Every day when I got home from work the neighbours would have deliberately obstructed my parking spot with their bin. 'We live on a very narrow street so everyone keeps their wheelie bin tight to the front of their house but for some reason next door liked to keep their bin on my side. 'They objected to me moving it out of the way and started to smear builders grease on the handle so I wouldn't touch it. 'They also wrote signs warning me not to touch their bin. It was so childish.' When she attempted to move the bin out of the way her neighbours claimed she was tampering with their property. Describing the birthday cake incident, she added: 'I'd had enough by this point so I grabbed the cake out of the bin and plonked it on the neighbour's door step. 'But the next thing I knew Gary's daughters were out of the house and screaming at me. Screaming confrontation: After dumping the half-eaten birthday cake on Jones' doorstep, Ms Dowling claimed she was angrily confronted by his daughters. Jones pictured with daughter Paige, above . 'I couldn't believe there was so much grief coming my way over our bins so I went home.' The next day Jones, 58 knocked on her front door. She anticipated that he was calling by to apologise and opened the door to greet him but he lunged at her - shouting and swearing. She said: 'I opened the door and he burst in and grabbed me by the top. He yelled and swore at me and shoved me onto the sofa. 'Luckily my boyfriend was home and he's a big bloke - there's no way Gary would have argued with him.' Following the altercation Ms Dowling called the police and Jones was charged with a public order offence. Restraining order: The mother had Jones arrested after he allegedly attacked her in her own home, grabbing her by the top and pushing her on to a sofa . At Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court he was given a fine of £360 plus a ten-week community order. He was also made the subject of a three-year restraining order not to contact Ms Dowling, her partner or children, and not to attend her property. Gareth Walters, defending, said that what had started as a 'petty dispute' between two neighbours had led to an 'out-of-control' situation.

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama decides whether to strike ISIS inside Syria, he has political considerations as well. U.S. lawmakers are watching critically as Obama weighs options on how to deal with the threat from ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Many have argued the surge of ISIS is the direct result of lack of strategic action to date from Obama, while others are questioning how broadly Obama's executive authority extends when it comes to taking militarily action. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, tells CNN that unless the United States or its citizens face an imminent threat from ISIS, Obama must seek approval from Congress before extended airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria. \"I do think the president should come to Congress if he intends to embark on airstrikes in Syria for the purpose of trying to defeat ISIL,\" Schiff said Saturday. \"If we're talking about the same kind of more general airstrikes we're undertaking in Iraq, that's something that would broaden the mission significantly. And, frankly, I think the case hasn't been made for that yet.\" Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and a Republican from California, told CNN that he'd support the use of armed drones on ISIS in Syria. \"I think strikes at this point, against the Syrian ISIS, which has bled into Iraq, those steps should be taken,\" Royce said. \"Had they been taken some time ago, I think ISIS would not have as much influence on the ground as it has now.\" U.N.: 'Unspeakable' suffering in Iraqi town besieged by ISIS fighters . Royce said he would not, however, support putting U.S. troops on the ground. \"There is no support in the United States on either side of the aisle for introducing ground troops there,\" Royce said. \"The question is: do we support the Kurds? Do we support the Free Syrian Army in their effort to turn back ISIS? And in doing that, we need to give them the heavy equipment such as anti-tank missiles that desperately they need.\" \"The most important aspect of this is that this needs to be a dialogue between Congress and the administration in terms of having a strategic plan forward in supporting the Kurdish forces on the ground,\" said Royce. \"That's the infantry that is right now advancing against ISIS, and they need the support.\" Perry piles on President . Republican Gov. Rick Perry of Texas tied the ISIS threat into a broader critique of six years of the Obama doctrine. \"When we think about where we are in the international scene, we think about the lack of leadership,\" Perry said. \"When we see what's happened in Libya, Egypt, Israel, Syria, Ukraine and now back in Iraq that we were told three years ago was secure and al Qaeda was on the run and we see the enemy that we are having to deal with.\" Perry, who is considering a bid for the Republican nomination in 2016, made the remarks at a rally for New Hampshire Republican activists. The United States on Saturay carried out another airstrike in near the strategically important Mosul Dam in Iraq, according to the Defense Department. It's the 62nd such strike in support of Kurdish forces fighting for control of the dam and the 94th of the campaign against ISIS, which began August 8 and has included daily strikes. U.S. intelligence agencies are gathering information on the locations of ISIS leadership and troops in Syria, two U.S. officials have told CNN. Separately, U.S. officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in Iraq and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside Syria against ISIS targets. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey signaled the United States was gearing up for a significant change both in rhetoric and action regarding ISIS in Syria. \"Can [ISIS] be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no,\" Dempsey told reporters Thursday. \"That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border. And that will come when we have a coalition in the region that takes on the task of defeating ISIS over time.\" Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst who has researched terror groups for decades, said it will be difficult to defeat ISIS without ground forces. 'What does day two look like?' But American's gloomy feelings of war fatigue will make consensus building for action in Syria a difficult sell. \"President Obama has been very reluctant to get involved in Syria because what does day two look like?\" Bergen said. \"Two of the most effective fighting forces in Syria are al Qaeda or al Qaeda splinter groups, or groups like Hezbollah, backed by Iran. So if you intervene, you may be helping Iran and Hezbollah and [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's] regime.\" Royce told CNN, however, that there are groups in Syria with which the United States can align. \"We should be arming the Free Syrian Army,\" Royce said. \"It was the opposition to Assad. It was clear that ISIS in a vacuum would move into that position. That's what we have seen happen.\" Adding another layer to the political and security calculus for the White House, intervention in Syria is more complicated than the ongoing airstrikes in Iraq due to international law, Bergen said. \"You could imagine some combination of U.S. Special Forces in small numbers, drone strikes, and airstrikes in Syria just as has been taking place in Iraq. But it's a pretty big bridge to cross,\" Bergen said. \"The Iraq government is inviting us to do these strikes in Iraq. The Syrian government certainly wouldn't be inviting us to intervene militarily in Syria. So there's a good question of international law, which after all the administration and the United States has good reasons to uphold.\"\""

A giant drone with the wingspan of a Boeing 757 commercial airliner is set to give the U.S. Navy the edge when it comes to spying. The Triton drone has completed its ninth flight trial to prove its ability to operate at a range of altitudes, speeds and weights. The drone could take to the skies in a few years and is designed to fly at high altitudes to provide surveillance and intelligence in realtime. A fleet of giant military drones called Tritons (pictured) with a wingspan the size of a commercial airliner are set to take to the skies in just a few years after successful tests . Triton boasts a wingspan of 130 feet and a collection of sensors, which gives its operators a 360 degree view that stretches for 2,000 nautical miles. It has been been developed by the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman, which claims the drone will let reconnaissance specialists monitor targets from a greater height and at a further distance then other drones. The unmanned aircraft can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships. Operators will be able to control the craft’s radar and high-resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units. The company believes the drone could be used to support military missions on the ground around the clock in as early as 2017. The wing structure of the drone was put through structural strength tests in late August by engineers. They successfully demonstrated the wing is 22 per cent stronger than the U.S. Navy's requirement in their lab (pictured) Should the drone drift from its programmed flight path because of turbulence, it can get back on course without intervention - a skill which it as demonstrated in a recent test flight. Triton has been tested in nine flights of over nine hours at altitudes of 50,000 feet in Palmdale, California. The structural strength of its wings has also been tested in a vast lab as the craft will swoop from high altitudes to get a closer look at targets as part of its missions. ‘A team of engineers found that no failures or unacceptable deformations of the wing occurred when it was subjected to a load at 22 per cent above the Navy's requirement,’ according to a company spokesman. The Triton drone has the wingspan of a Boeing 757 commercial airliner (pictured) and is set to give the U.S. Navy the edge when it comes to spying . Mike Mackey, Triton UAS programme director at Northrop Gumman, said: ‘During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification.’ ‘The wing’s strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.’ The U.S. Navy has ordered 68 of the MQ-4C Triton drones and they are expected to take to the skies on real missions in 2017. The unmanned aircraft (pictured on a test flight) can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships. Military operators will be able to control the craft's radar and high-resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units . Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in . ‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according . to a new roadmap. Unmanned aircraft carrying strong chemical . weapons could also be on the horizon, the U.S. Department of Defence . (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap.

Action: Some in the food industry believe stevia powder, which is 300 time sweeter than sugar but has no calories, could help tackle obesity . It sounds too good to be true - all the sweetness of sugar but with none of the calories. But an extract from a plant found growing wild in South America is being trumpeted as a major weapon in tackling the obesity crisis threatening the health of millions of people around the world. The natural sweetener called stevia is 300 times sweeter than traditional beet or cane sugar and could be a way for people with a sweet tooth to satisfy their sugar cravings totally guilt-free. Dr Margaret Ashwell, a member of the . Scientific Advisory Board of the Global Stevia Institute, an information . service provided by the main suppliers of stevia, believes the health benefits cannot be understated. 'Stevia . can help people enjoy natural-origin sweetness while reducing calories . as part of a healthful, balanced diet,' she told the Independent. She added: 'There are enormous opportunities for industry to meet national . and international pledges to reduce sugar in products to help the . obesity crisis.' Used for thousands of years in South . America cooking, it was added to food as a sweetener as well as a health . tonic and treatment for high blood pressure, heartburn, gout and type 2 . diabetes. Now . multi-national food companies are catching on to the possible benefits . of stevia and are introducing it into to a range of low-calorie . products. According to the National Health . Service's 2013 Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet, 65 per . cent of men and 58 per cent of women are overweight or obese in . England, with the numbers continuing to rise. So the plant, used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from . relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies . such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years. Sales of the extract have soared in recent years - up 400 per cent between 2008 and 2012. In 2011 it was approved by the European Food Safety Agency for widespread introduction. Miracle plant: An extract from the leaves of a stevia bush are 300 times sweeter than sugar - but with none of the calories . Some critics have questioned if a calorie free supplement can possibly help in longterm fat loss diets. Dr Robert Lustig, author of Fat . Chance: The Bitter Truth About Sugar, said that weight-loss diets might . not be achieved because the body expects real sugar, the Independent . reported. But this doubt over the effects of . stevia has not stopped some food manufactures introducing the additive . to some of their most popular ranges. In March, this year, fizzy drink . Sprite ditched its 'full-fat' recipe in favour of a lower-calorie . version that uses the 'natural' sweetener. The new formulation of the popular . beverage contains 30 per cent fewer calories - but fans fear it . will have an unusual aftertaste. The . drink is being altered as part of the parent company Coca-Cola's . anti-obesity drive and follows a call by the government to address the . issue. Guilt-free: Stevia, pictured being cultivated for use in the food industry, is being described as an ingredient which could help tackle obesity by cutting the calories in junk food and fizzy drinks . A Coca-Cola spokesman said: 'We are introducing Sprite with Stevia in the UK. Research into stevia’s alleged health benefits have been mixed and many believe the plant could in fact pose health risks. Some research has found that the plant lowered blood pressure. There has also been research into its effects on diabetes. The most obvious benefit of stevia is that it provides sweetness but does not elevate blood glucose levels as white sugar does. But in addition to this, early research has shown that it can actively lower blood sugars. Scientists found that taking 1000 mg daily of stevioside reduced blood sugar levels after meals by up to 18 per cent in people with type 2 diabetes. Other alleged benefits of stevia were analysed in a 2009 review of recent stevia research. Experts at  Mahidol University in Thailand found that a number of studies did show stevia to have blood pressure-lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, anti-diarrheal, diuretic, and immunomodulatory actions. This will contain 30 per cent fewer calories and, instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the Sprite range, it will completely replace the current Sprite,' it read. 'Stevia, a sweetener from natural origins, is sweeter than sugar but without the calories. 'It is an extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to Paraguay. Stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense, natural sweetness.' The increasing introduction of the calourie-free natural sweetener comes amid mounting concern about the health effects of the soft drinks enjoyed by millions of Britons every day. Heart attacks, diabetes, weight gain, brittle bones, pancreatic and prostate cancer, muscle weakness and paralysis have all been flagged up as potential problems of drinking soft drinks. Earlier this year, a study warned that just one can of a sugary soft drink a day can raise the risk of diabetes by up to a fifth. A can of Coke contains around eight teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories. This is around 7 per cent of the 2,000 calories a woman is recommended per day. Two cans would use up more than a tenth of a man’s 2,500 daily calorie allowance. Harvard University’s respected School of Public Health warns that sugary drinks ‘are a major contributor to the obesity epidemic’. Research it cites to back this up includes a 20-year study of 120,000 men and women which found those that drank an extra soft drink a day gained, on average, a pound a year more than those that did not up their intake. Over seven years, it would add up to half a stone.\""

          "content": "Summarize the following text in exactly two sentences: \n \"(CNN) -- Adam Silver has been NBA commissioner for only a few months. A few relatively controversy-free months. Now -- with the longtime owner of a top team alleged to have made racist remarks in a recorded conversation posted on a celebrity-focused website -- Silver is stepping down a new road. Only one owner has been suspended in 68 years. That was Minnesota's Glen Taylor in 2000, when the Timberwolves made a secret deal with a star player to circumvent salary cap rules. The league has never forced an owner to give up his team. Should Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling face either of those punishments for the recording that TMZ.com says is him talking to his girlfriend V. Stiviano? First, the NBA says, it will investigate the matter to determine whether the recorded conversation is authentic, whether it is actually Sterling and whether it has been edited or manipulated. \"All members of the NBA family should be afforded due process and a fair opportunity to present their side of any controversy, which is why I'm not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against Donald Sterling,\" Silver told reporters Saturday. Silver said the league will move \"extraordinarily quickly\" in its investigation and he hoped to have an initial report in \"the next few days.\" He indicated the NBA had been in contact with Sterling already, saying the league's longest-tenured owner had agreed not to travel to Oakland, California, on Sunday where the Clippers are playing the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the NBA playoffs. Silver: 'Broad powers in place' There is no clear answer as to what the discipline should be, if the accusations against Sterling -- who has yet to comment publicly -- are true. \"There are broad powers in place under the NBA's constitution and bylaws that include a range of sanctions and all of those will be considered depending on the findings of our investigation,\" Silver said Saturday. According to the website TMZ, Sterling made the alleged discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with girlfriend V. Stiviano on April 9. TMZ posted a 10-minute recording of the argument online Friday. The law firm representing Stiviano said the recording is a portion of an hourlong conversation between the couple. If authentic, the remarks seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and for posting such pictures on her Instagram account. \"This is a failure of leadership on so many levels,\" Jason Johnson, an HLN contributor and a political science professor at Hiram College, said. \"This is not the first time we have had an owner get in trouble, and they should have had rules in place to deal with these kinds of situations.\" The most likely penalties, said CNN Sports anchor Andy Scholes, are a fine and a suspension, possibly banning the 80-year-old Sterling from team operations for as long as a year. TNT analyst Charles Barkley said there's no question Silver should suspend Sterling soon. \"He's got to suspend him right now,\" Barkley said Saturday night. \"First of all, they have to prove it is his voice on the tape, but this is the first big test of Adam Silver. You can't have this guy making statements like that. He has to suspend him and fine him immediately.\" Sterling has never been sanctioned by the league since he bought the team in 1981. Other owners have been fined, most notably Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who has paid out nearly $2 million in 19 fines, according to Bleacher Report. One fine reportedly was $500,000, about the same amount Miami Heat owner Micky Arison supposedly had to pay in 2011. But those were for remarks about officiating (Cuban) and the lockout (Arison). And a similar record-level fine for the Clippers owner might not seem like much to the public, since Sterling is worth billions. The league probably cannot force Sterling to give up the team, which according to Forbes magazine is worth $575 million, Scholes said. According to Scholes, the NBA constitution is confidential, and reportedly the league would only step in to remove an owner if the team were in financial trouble. A team on the rise . The value of the Clippers, who were a terrible team for decades, has been on the rise with their recent success on the court. Led by all-stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, who is also the head of the players union, the team has set win records in the past two seasons. The other players will look to Paul for guidance, but a players walkout is unlikely. \"They are looking at Chris Paul and they are trying to see what can they actually do to show their disdain and dislike (for Sterling),\" Johnson said. The NBA will face an image problem if Sterling turns out to be the voice on the recording, in which a man tells a woman that she shouldn't be seen at Clippers games with Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson because he is African-American. The question would become: Could the Clippers sign any free agents in the offseason if Sterling remains the owner? LeBron James, who could potentially be one of those free agents, indicated he wouldn't consider playing for Sterling's Clippers. \"There's no room for Donald Sterling in the NBA,\" he said Saturday before the Miami Heat played the Charlotte Bobcats. \"There is no room for him.\" James told ESPN he was certain Silver would take care of the matter. Jason Johnson said Silver needs to be forceful. \"He can say, 'Look, you have damaged the brand. You have damaged the league, and consequently, I think we are going to have to look at your right to own this team,' \" Johnson said. Sterling has faced questions tied to racial issues in the past. In 2009 he settled -- while admitting no liability -- three lawsuits tied to discrimination claims at apartments he owned in Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Times reported. He also settled a 2003 lawsuit that claimed he wouldn't rent to Latinos, the Times reported. Sterling was sued in 2009 by former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor, who said he was a victim of age and racial discrimination. Baylor dropped the race claim and a jury ruled in Sterling's favor. Silver said Saturday that Sterling's past \"hasn't so far\" played into the investigation. \"We're very focused on the audio tape ... and the facts around it.\" The NBA playoffs will continue through mid-June, when the league will crown a champion.\""

Sara Friedman, 33, and her little girl Blima were crossing the street in Borough Park, Brooklyn, about 9.15pm when they were both struck down by a grey Honda minivan traveling north on 8th Avenue and 60th Street. Witnesses at the scene say the mother was screaming for her daughter after being pinned underneath the vehicle, but remained conscious throughout. The male driver, identified as 22-year-old  Bilal Ghumman, had reportedly taken the car from his job as a valet parking attendant so that he could run an errand. Horror crash: Mother, 33, and her daughter, 10, were struck down by this minivan on 8th Ave in Borough Park, Brooklyn, on Tuesday night . Scene: Belongings were strewn across the road following the crash, which killed the 10-year-old girl . A shoe belonging to one of the victims is seen on the road in Borough Park, Brooklyn, on Tuesday night . Emergency crews were able to free Friedman from underneath the car, according to The Yeshiva World. The mother was rushed to Lutheran Medical Center and her daughter was transported to Maimonides Medical Center. While the mother's condition was said to be serious but stable, her daughter Blima was pronounced dead from severe trauma. Doctors took Friedman, who was nine months pregnant, straight into delivery. She gave birth to a baby girl and both were in a satisfactory condition on Wednesday. Ghumman was taken into custody on an outstanding marijuana warrant. The New York Daily News reported that he passed a breathalyzer at the scene. However, he was reportedly working as a valet  at the time of the crash and was arrested for unauthorized use of a vehicle. He told police he had taken the car to buy cigarettes and a drink. On his Facebook page, Ghumman lists his job as a Rite Aid cashier. Investigation: Police have seized security footage from this store to determine whether to press charges . Closed: 60th Avenue was shut off on Tuesday night as police investigated the scene . Police will now determine whether Ghumman will charged over the crash. They have seized surveillance footage from a nearby 99 cent store. Footage taken at the scene showed a shoe and some other belongings strewn across the road. Witness Angel Santos told CBS New York the scene was upsetting . 'When I rounded the corner I saw the lady on the ground, the kid by her and she was holding her stomach,' he said. 'A guy was pacing — the guy from the car pacing. 'He wasn’t saying anything. He was just like, mad worried; he was just in total shock.' Sadly this is not the first time the family have been hit by tragedy. In 2009, another daughter of Sara and Yakov Friedman was critically injured in a house fire. The three-year-old girl suffered third degree burns following the fire in the home at 47th Street in Borough Park. The tot was able to survive the injuries and recovered. Tragedy: Yakov Friedman, father of the deceased 10-year-old, is seen here giving a speech thanking firefighters in 2009 for saving another daughter of his following a fire at their home .\""

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger continues to battle through an injury crisis for the Gunners and his options in goal have taken a hit in recently. 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez has taken over the gloves with No 1 choice Wojciech Szczesny out with a hip injury whereas summer signing David Ospina is still a long term absentee. 20-year-old Macey takes his seat on the substitutes bench on Saturday alongside Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Macey, in action for Arsenal's Under 21 side last season, has made a quick impact at the Gunners . Where has Macey come from? The 6ft 6in agreed a three-year deal with Arsenal after a trial last summer, snapping him from Bristol Rovers. What's his first-team experience? Macey only made his squad debut as an unused substitute for Bristol Rovers against Torquay in March 2012 but never made a professional appearance for the Conference side. Has he represented Arsenal yet? The Englishman started 15 games for the Under 21 side last season and managed to hold down the starting spot. However his appearance on the Arsenal bench at West Brom on Saturday was a first. Macey, in training with the first-team, has quickly risen through the ranks at Arsenal due to injuries . Was he destined to be a Gunner? Perhaps a coincidence but this is not the first time Macey has played for a team called Arsenal. The 20-year-old played for a local side in Bath called Avon Arsenal Comets when he was a kid, who even had a cannon in their emblem. Has it always been so promising? Arsenal's promising keeper was originally rejected by the Bristol Rovers' Centre of Excellence in 2007. However he didn't give up and turned out for Bath City and Yate Town before eventually joined the centre in 2009. he then became a full-time scholar in May 2011.\""

England made it two from two at the Women's Rugby World Cup in France, beating Spain 45-5 in the Pool A clash. Head coach Gary Street's side scored six tries to Spain's one, with Kay Wilson, Danielle Waterman, Laura Keates, Claire Allan and Marlie Packer - with two - all scoring and Emily Scarratt adding 15 points with the boot. After a cagey opening England broke the deadlock when a deft grubber through from fly-half Ceri Large bounced perfectly for Wilson to jump on for her third try of the tournament. Big win: Danielle Waterman breaks through the Spanish line to score one of England's six tries . Scarratt converted the try from wide, and the Lichfield centre duly added a penalty after 33 minutes. At 10-0 Spain continued to press, but some dancing feet from Waterman saw her get over the line for her 35th international try. England went into the break 17-0 up, and started the second half with real pace. First, Keates rumbled over to score after strong work from the pack before Allan was on hand to finish off a smart team move across the line for 31-0 and the bonus point. Scarratt converted both with ease and had her sixth successful kick after Packer barged her way over the line for her first try of the World Cup. Dominating: Ceri Large tries to ride the challenges from Spain's Marina Bravo and Paula Medin . With just over 10 minutes to play Spain were rewarded with their first try after a spell of pressure on England's line - Marina Bravo eventually diving over. But it was England who had the final say. Packer scored her second try after more strong work from the pack and Scarratt rounded off the win with the conversion, her seventh from seven attempts. Dynamic duo: Waterman causes the Spanish defence more problems while Emily Scarratt kicks some extras . England captain Sarah Hunter said: 'It was a tough game, we knew that Spain would come at us and cause us problems. 'It was a case of playing in the right areas and hoping that we would get the rewards - and eventually they came. 'Canada up next will be a huge test for us, we'll look at this game and take what we can out of it and then switch attention to that match on Saturday which will be a difficult game as they are an excellent side.' Big occasion: Spain and England walk out of the tunnel ahead of the game which England convincingly won .\""

Once an endangered species on the brink of extinction, the majestic gray whale is now a common sight off the California coast. The 40-foot, 40-ton behemoths have become so common that sightings off the Los Angeles coast have doubled since 2012. The huge pods are migrating from Alaska to Baja California in increasing numbers and scientists are baffled as to why it's happening. Scroll down for video... Prevalent: Whale watchers are delighted by the number of whales they are spotting swimming off the California coast this year . And while the researchers wonder if its a change in salinity, shifting currents or perhaps an explosion in population of the massive mammals that's made them such a common sight, whale watchers are delighted at their suddenly easy hobby. 'It’s pretty exciting. It’s the first time I’ve been out here and I’ve been in California for 50 years ,' whale watcher Trenna Cousins told KCAL. The folks at Captain Dave’s Dolphin & Whale Watching Safari couldn't be happier. Heading south: More than twice as many of the 40 ton majestic mammals have appeared off the California coast this season as they make their way to the warmer waters off Mexico . 'We’ve seen more whales than I have ever seen in my 20 years or so of being a captain,' said Captain Dan Salas while on an expedition Tuesday. The whales migrate each year from the arctic waters of the Bering Sea to the warm currents off the coast of Mexico. They aren't an uncommon sight around December, but they've certainly never been prevalent like they have been this past year. Scientists are puzzled as to why the whales are suddenly so common. 'It could  have to do with currents, it could have to do with temperature or salinity. It doesn't have to do with food because they don't eat on south- or north-bound migration,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger, director of the Gray Whale Census Project told CBS News. Thar she blows: A gray whale comes up for air as sprawling Los Angeles looms in the background. The species was once nearly extinct but has made a huge comeback in recent decades. While scientists are unsure if the cause is increased population, more gray whales than ever before are being spotted off the coast of California . While there is no evidence the whale population is increasing, scientists say this past year has seen an increase in the number of calves traveling in the massive pods. Despite the uncertainty, researchers hope the more prevalent sightings mean positive things are happening for the once-critically endangered creatures. 'It could very well mean that more are coming down because they're pregnant and ready to give birth, and others are coming down ready to get pregnant for the next year,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger.\""

A top jockey caught drink-driving walked free from court yesterday after claiming he was ‘sleep-driving’. Tom Queally, 30, who rode legendary winner Frankel, said he was a habitual sleep-walker and had no recollection of setting off in his BMW. When motorists saw him parked in the middle of the road and knocked on the window, he drove off and pulled on to a garage forecourt, where he fell asleep again with the engine running. He was woken by police who found he was more than two times the drink-drive limit. Drink-driving carries a maximum jail term of six months. Queally was represented by Nick Freeman – known as Mr Loophole after defending celebrities such as Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham against motoring charges – who said the jockey had been a sleep-walker from childhood. But millionaire Queally was forced to plead guilty to the offence as a sleeping condition is not a legal defence. He walked free from court after District Judge Bridget Knight banned him from the road for 22 months and ordered him to pay costs and fines of almost £5,000. Crewe Magistrates’ Court was told the Irish jockey, who earned £2.5million in one year, had been out for dinner with his agent Nicholas Whittle. He was supposed to sleep at Mr Whittle’s house, but got up and went off in his £70,000 BMW 730. He was spotted by another motorist asleep in the car at 5am on March 16 in the middle of a road in Knutsford, Cheshire. Queally then drove off and was later seen parked at a Shell garage five miles away, asleep in the passenger seat. When officers breathalysed him, he had 84mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath – more than twice the legal limit of 35mg. Kate Marchuk, prosecuting, said Queally ‘rolled out’ of a police car and curled up on the ground like he was napping. Mr Freeman said: ‘He was unaware of what he was doing – he was sleep-driving. The defendant’s last recollection was lying on the bed, fully clothed, reading Horse & Hound magazine. ‘While asleep... he drove for no reason 300 or so yards and parked in the carriageway. Mr Queally is blameless. This is not a man who has knowingly got into a car while drunk. He has no defence in terms of guilt but is completely innocent on a moral basis.’ Victory: The jockey is most famous for being the regular rider of 'wonder horse' Frankel. The pair are pictured winning the Qipco Champion Stakes during QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot in 2012 . Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, of the London Sleep Centre, told the court: ‘Mr Queally has a long history of sleep-walking, and his brother and father were sleep-walkers. ‘From a medical perspective he was unaware of his actions.’ Outside court, Mr Freeman said it was time for sleep-walking to be recognised by the law, adding: ‘Perversely, had he raped or murdered someone, this would have provided him with a defence, but not for drink-driving – and that is not fair.’ Embarassing: Queally initally claimed he had not been drinking, then 'rolled' out of a police car and lay down on the ground after being arrested .\""

A dying schoolgirl desperately seeking a bone marrow transplant to save her from a rare deadly illness is being kept alive - with horse blood. Zoe Gilbert, 11, has a form of aplastic anaemia which doctors believe can only be a cured by a transplant. The condition, also called bone marrow failure, affects the blood and is caused by the bone marrow and stem cells not producing enough blood cells. So far, Zoe’s desperate family have failed to find a match for the youngster. Zoe Gilbert, 11, is dying from rare aplastic anaemia, which attacks her immune system. Doctors are keeping her alive with medicine made from horse anitbodies. Pictured with her mother Elizabeth and sister Kirstie . Instead, the schoolgirl is having her dangerously weak immune system boosted - by horse blood. A serum from the equine blood is injected into Zoe because it contains antithymocyte globulin (ATG) - an antibody which doctors hope will kick-start her immune system. Incredibly, the treatment has a range of bizarre side effects, including the growth of facial hair. There is also a risk Zoe could contract a deadly infection - but medics believe her illness is so bad the chance is worth taking. Zoe will have to wait for four weeks after the treatment is completed to find out whether it has been successful. If it doesn’t work, her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to come forward and save her life. Zoe’s mother Elizabeth Gilbert today launched an urgent appeal for more donors to sign up to the bone marrow register to ‘secure Zoe’s life’. She said: ‘It’s very difficult at the moment not knowing what will happen. My biggest fear is it not working and having to go through it again. ‘A transplant would secure Zoe’s life. Even if we don’t find a match,donors could save other people’s lives.' Zoe's sister, Kirstie Gilbert, 24, added: 'We are just desperate for her to be well again. Zoe wants to go to sleepover parties and not worry about getting sick. She has just started secondary school and is only able to do three days a week. The nursery school teacher, added: 'There are so many risks with this treatment and her body could reject it or relapse from it at any time. Doctors hope the antibodies will kick-start Zoe's immune system. If not, her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to save her life . 'She's my little sister - I take her to have her nails done and treat her to shoes to try and cheer her up. 'But there are only so many pairs of shoes you can buy - she just wants her life back.' Every year, thousands of patients with blood cancer and other blood disorders are given transplants of healthy bone marrow. Their own diseased marrow is first destroyed to prevent the new marrow from being rejected and to create space for the transplanted tissue. Zoe, who lives with her family in Impington, Cambridgeshire, was diagnosed with the condition by doctors at Addenbrooke’s Hospital after she had ten nose bleeds in just two weeks. The condition means her bone marrow fails to reproduce red and white blood cells and platelets, which prevent bruising, and leaves Zoe with little resistance to infections. Zoe, a student who loves football and swimming, has to have blood and platelet transfusions every week - spending days at a time in hospital. Staff at Addenbrooke’s hospital and the Anthony Nolan charity, which manages the UK bone marrow register, have searched world-wide but failed to find a suitable donor for Zoe. Research shows that family members are not necessarily compatible and it is more likely that a complete stranger will be an exact match. Children who do not have a brother or sister who is a good bone marrow match can be treated with a immunosuppressive therapy using antibodies from horse and rabbit blood. The horse therapy reduces the number of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream using drugs such as antilymphocyte globulin (ATG) and ciclosporin, which stimulate the bone marrow to restart blood cell production. Myles Bradbury, consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, said; 'For children who do not having a sibling bone marrow match the second option is an unrelated match. 'If, as in this case, we cannot find a match we use horse ATG, which has an 85 per cent survival rate.' The antibodies are given to the patient in a liquid medicine intravenously through a central line in the neck. Unfortunately, the main side effect of ciclosporin is extra hair growth on the body, which can be quite obvious on the face. Patients can also suffer from high temperatures, rashes and swollen, painful joints. Zoe has to be kept in hospital for three weeks and closely monitored in isolation as she will be prone to fatal infection while undergoing the treatment. Dr Michael Gattens, consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, said: ‘Ideally bone marrow is the best option but without a match we use ATG. ‘It is a pretty intensive treatment and can result in serum sickness, but we can only carry out marrow transplants if we have a perfect match - it is essential for this condition, otherwise it won’t work. ‘Zoe will be in hospital for three weeks and she will be kept in isolation and closely monitored for infection which in many cases can be fatal.’ He added: ‘For most people, a transplant is a long-term solution. Occasionally, many years down the line, people relapse.’ Aplastic anaemia affects only one in every 200,000 people and in many cases the reasons behind the condition are not clear. Experts estimate only about 30 to 40 children are diagnosed with aplastic anaemia each year.It can affect anyone at any age but seems to occur most often in children and people over 60 years old.
